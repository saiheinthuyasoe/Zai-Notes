# Step 1: Create an IAM User in AWS IAM

## a. Login to AWS Console
- Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
- Sign in with your AWS credentials.

## b. Navigate to IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- In the AWS Management Console, type **IAM** in the search bar.
- Click on **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** from the search results.

## c. Create a New User
- On the left-hand menu, click on **Users**.
- Click on the **Add users** button.

## d. Set Up the New User
- **User name**: Enter a name for the user (e.g., `s3-user`).
- **Access type**: Select the checkbox for **Programmatic access**. This will allow the user to use the AWS CLI, SDKs, or other tools to interact with AWS programmatically.
- Click **Next: Permissions** to proceed.

## e. Attach Permissions (Grant S3 Access)
- On the **Set permissions** page, choose **Attach policies directly**.
- In the search bar, type **AmazonS3FullAccess** and select the policy that appears.
  - **AmazonS3FullAccess** provides the user full access to all S3 actions. If you want more restrictive access, you can choose a different policy or create a custom one.
- Click **Next: Tags** (optional).

## f. (Optional) Add Tags
- You can add key-value pairs (tags) to help identify or categorize this user (this is optional and can be skipped).
- After adding tags (if needed), click **Next: Review**.

## g. Review and Create the User
- Review all the settings youâ€™ve selected (programmatic access, policy, etc.).
- Once everything looks good, click **Create user**.

## h. Download the Credentials
- After successfully creating the user, you will see a screen displaying the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.
- **Important**: Download these credentials as a CSV file or copy them and store them in a safe place. You won't be able to view the secret access key again after this point.
- These credentials are required to interact with AWS programmatically (e.g., via the AWS SDK or CLI).

### What You Should Have Now:
- **Access Key ID**: This is the public identifier for the IAM user.
- **Secret Access Key**: This is the private key used to authenticate the programmatic requests made to AWS.

## i. Check AWS CLI Installation
- Run the following command to check if the AWS CLI is installed:  
  ```bash
  aws --version
  ```  
  If the AWS CLI is not installed, download and install it from the [AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

## j. Configure AWS CLI
- Run the following command to configure the AWS CLI with the IAM user credentials:  
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```  
- Use the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** from the CSV file you downloaded earlier (e.g., `s3-user_accessKeys.csv`).
- When prompted, enter the following details:
  - **AWS Access Key ID**: Paste the Access Key ID.
  - **AWS Secret Access Key**: Paste the Secret Access Key.
  - **Default region name**: Enter your preferred region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
  - **Default output format**: Leave it as `json` or choose your preferred format.

Now, your AWS CLI is configured with the IAM user credentials, and you can start using it to interact with AWS services.
```

# Step 2: Create a New Bucket in AWS S3

1. **List S3 Buckets**  
   Run the following command to see the list of S3 buckets:  
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls
   ```

2. **Create a New Bucket**  
   Use the following CLI command to create a new bucket:  
   ```bash
   aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <bucket-name> --region us-east-1
   ```

3. **Download and Prepare the Zip File**  
   a. Download the zip file from the following link:  
      [https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/CUR-TF-200-ACCDEV-2-91558/05-lab-lambda/code.zip](https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/CUR-TF-200-ACCDEV-2-91558/05-lab-lambda/code.zip)  
   
   b. Extract the zip file and open it in VSCode.  
   
   c. Use the following CLI command to upload the website folder to the S3 bucket:  
      ```bash
      aws s3 cp resources/website s3://<bucket-name>/ --recursive --cache-control "max-age=0"
      ```  
      This will upload all the website files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, assets, etc.) to the S3 bucket.

4. **Access the Website**  
   - Go to the `index.html` file in the S3 bucket and copy the Object URL (e.g., `https://hello-bad-cafe.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html`).  
   - Paste the URL into your browser.  
   - You will see an **Access Denied** error.

5. **Get Your IP Address**  
   - Go to [https://whatismyipaddress.com/](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) in your browser.  
   - Copy your **IPv4 address**.

6. **Update the Bucket Policy**  
   - Locate the `public_policy.json` file in the `resources` folder of the extracted `code.zip` folder.  
   - Follow these steps to add the `public_policy.json` to the bucket policy:  

   a. Edit the `public_policy.json` file in VSCode:  
      - Replace `<FMI1>` with your bucket name.  
      - Replace `<FMI2>` with your IPv4 address (copied in Step 5).  

   b. Edit the `permission.py` file:  
      - Update the line:  
        ```python
        policy_file = open("resources/public_policy.json", "r")
        ```  

   c. Go to the **Bucket Permissions** section in the AWS S3 console:  
      - Click **Edit** under **Bucket Policy**.  
      - Enable the following options:  
        - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs).  
        - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs).  
        - Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies.  
      - Click **Save**.  

   d. Check if `boto3` is installed:  
      ```bash
      pip show boto3
      ```  
      If `boto3` is not installed, install it using:  
      ```bash
      pip install boto3
      ```  
      (Without `boto3`, you won't be able to run Python files like `permission.py`.)  

   e. Run the following command to set permissions:  
      ```bash
      python resources/permission.py
      ```  
      or  
      ```bash
      python3 resources/permission.py
      ```  
      You should see the output:  
      ```
      Setting Permissions - DONE
      ```  

   - The bucket policy will now be updated with the necessary permissions.  

7. **Access the Website Again**  
   - Go back to the `index.html` URL (from Step 4).  
   - You should now be able to access the website without the **Access Denied** error.
```

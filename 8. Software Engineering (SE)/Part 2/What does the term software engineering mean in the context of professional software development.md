# What does the term "software engineering" mean in the context of professional software development?

### **Software Engineering Overview**  
Software engineering is about creating, maintaining, and improving software systems. It’s a key part of modern economies because software controls many aspects of businesses and daily life. It involves using methods, theories, and tools to develop software professionally. Investing in software development is a big part of a country’s economy (Gross National Product).

### **Software Costs**  
- **Software drives costs**: In computer systems, software often costs more than hardware.  
- **Maintenance is expensive**: Keeping software running and updated can cost more than developing it initially, especially for long-lasting systems.  
- **Good engineering saves money**: Using proper software engineering techniques makes development more efficient and cost-effective.

---

### **Why Software Projects Fail**  
1. **Not using software engineering methods**: Skipping proper techniques leads to unreliable and expensive software.  
2. **Increasing complexity**: As systems grow more complex, they need to be built faster and with more features, which can be challenging.

---

### **Types of Software**  
1. **Generic Products**:  
   - Stand-alone software sold to anyone (e.g., PC software, accounting programs, drawing tools).  
   - The developer decides what it does and whether to update it.  

2. **Custom Products**:  
   - Software made specifically for a client (e.g., taxi apps, bug tracking tools).  
   - The client decides what it does and requests changes.

---

### **Characteristics of Good Software**  
- **Efficiency**: Uses resources like memory and processing power wisely.  
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update as needs change.  
- **Dependability and Security**: Reliable, safe, and secure from harm or hacking.  
- **Acceptability**: Easy to use, works well with other systems, and meets user needs.

### **What is Software Engineering?**  
It’s a branch of engineering focused on all stages of software development, from planning to maintenance. It involves:  
- Solving problems using theories and methods.  
- Managing costs and organizational limits.  
- Not just coding, but also managing projects and improving tools and processes.

### **Importance of Software Engineering**  
As society relies more on software, we need to build systems that are reliable, fast, and affordable. Using software engineering techniques saves money in the long run, especially since most costs come from updating software after it’s been used.

---

### **Software Process Activities**  
1. **Specification**: Defining what the software should do.  
2. **Development**: Designing and coding the software.  
3. **Validation**: Testing to ensure it meets user needs.  
4. **Evolution**: Updating the software as needs change.

---

### **Factors Affecting Software**  
- **Heterogeneity**: Software must work on different devices and systems.  
- **Business and social change**: Software needs to adapt quickly to new trends.  
- **Security and trust**: Software must be safe and reliable.  
- **Scale**: Software ranges from small apps to large cloud systems.

### **Types of Software Applications**  
1. **Stand-alone**: Runs on a single device (e.g., PC software).  
2. **Interactive transaction-based**: Accessed remotely (e.g., e-commerce apps).  
3. **Embedded control**: Manages hardware (e.g., car systems).  
4. **Batch processing**: Handles large amounts of data (e.g., payroll systems).  
5. **Entertainment**: For personal enjoyment (e.g., games).  
6. **Modelling and simulation**: Simulates real-world processes (e.g., weather models).  
7. **Data collection**: Gathers data from sensors (e.g., IoT devices).  
8. **Systems of systems**: Combines multiple software systems.

### **Basics of Software Engineering**  
- Use a clear and controlled development process.  
- Focus on reliability and performance.  
- Understand and manage software requirements.  
- Reuse existing software when possible.

---

### **Software Engineering for Mobile and the Internet**  
- **Web and mobile apps**: Businesses are shifting to web-based systems.  
- **Web services**: Allow access to software over the internet.  
- **Cloud computing**: Software runs remotely, and users pay based on usage.

---

### **Internet-Based Software Engineering**  
- **Incremental and agile development**: Build and release software in stages.  
- **Software reuse**: Use existing components to build new systems.  
- **Service-oriented systems**: Build software using web services.  
- **Rich interfaces**: Use advanced tools like AJAX and HTML5 for better user experiences.

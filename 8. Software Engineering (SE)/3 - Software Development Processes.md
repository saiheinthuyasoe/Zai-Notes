## **What is the Software Development Process?**
The **Software Development Process** is the procedure for creating a software application. It consists of a series of steps required to enhance, modify, or create a new software system.

### **Steps in Software Development Process:**
1. **Specification** – Defining what the software should do (requirements).
2. **Design & Implementation** – Deciding how the software should be structured and building it.
3. **Validation** – Checking if the software meets customer expectations.
4. **Evolution** – Updating the software as customer needs change.

## **Software Process Models**
A **Software Process Model** is an abstract representation of how software is developed. It provides a structured approach to software creation.

### **Common Software Process Models**
1. **Waterfall Model** (Step-by-step, linear approach)
2. **Incremental Development** (Software built in small parts)
3. **Integration & Configuration** (Using pre-built modules)

### **Example:**
Imagine building a **car**.
- **Waterfall Model** – You fully design and assemble the car before testing.
- **Incremental Model** – You build the engine first, then the seats, then the wheels, testing each step.
- **Integration Model** – You use pre-made parts (like ready-made seats) instead of building them from scratch.

## **Plan-Driven vs Agile Methods**
### **Plan-Driven Method**
- Everything is planned before starting.
- Follows strict procedures.
- Changes are difficult.
- Example: **Building a bridge** (every step must be planned).

### **Agile Method**
- Planning is flexible.
- Changes are easier to handle.
- Example: **Developing a mobile app** (features can change based on user feedback).

### **Real-World Example**
- A bank software system (secure & fixed requirements) → **Plan-driven approach**
- A startup launching an app (frequent updates) → **Agile approach**

### **Mapping Software Development Models to Plan-Driven & Agile Approaches**  

| **Development Model**             | **Plan-Driven or Agile?** | **Explanation** |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **Waterfall Model**               | **Plan-Driven**         | - The Waterfall model follows a **linear and sequential** process where all requirements are gathered upfront, and each phase (e.g., requirements, design, implementation, testing) is completed before moving to the next. <br> - **Not flexible**, making it unsuitable for dynamic changes. |
| **Incremental Development Model** | **Agile** (Mostly)       | - The system is built in **small increments**, each adding new functionality. <br> - Allows for **continuous feedback and iteration**, making it more aligned with **Agile principles**. <br> - Can also be Plan-Driven in cases where requirements are fixed for each increment. |
| **Integration & Configuration Model** | **Mostly Plan-Driven, but can be Agile** | - Focuses on reusing existing components, third-party software, or frameworks to build a system. <br> - If pre-defined components are selected first and integrated following a strict plan, it’s **Plan-Driven**. <br> - If integration happens iteratively with evolving requirements, it can be **Agile**. |

### **Summary**  
- **Waterfall** → Strictly **Plan-Driven**.  
- **Incremental Development** → **Mostly Agile**, but can have a plan-driven approach in structured environments.  
- **Integration & Configuration** → **Mostly Plan-Driven**, but adaptable to Agile if iterative integration is used.

## **Waterfall Model (Step-by-Step Approach)**
The **Waterfall Model** follows a **linear** process where each step must be completed before moving to the next.

### **Steps in the Waterfall Model:**
1. **Preliminary Investigation** – Identifying the problem.
2. **Project Identification & Planning** – Finding possible solutions and planning.
3. **System Analysis** – Understanding how the current system works.
4. **System Design** – Deciding how the new system should work.
5. **Development** – Writing the actual code.
6. **Testing & Implementation** – Checking if the software works properly.
7. **Maintenance** – Fixing issues and making improvements.

### **Example:**
**Building a school**
1. Investigate the need for a new school.
2. Plan the design and structure.
3. Analyze the land and location.
4. Design the classrooms and facilities.
5. Build the school.
6. Test safety measures and ensure everything is working.
7. Maintain the school over time.

### **Problems with the Waterfall Model:**
- Difficult to make changes once the process starts.
- Not suitable for projects where requirements change frequently.

## **Incremental Development (Building in Small Parts)**
Instead of building everything at once, **Incremental Development** builds the system in small parts, which are continuously improved.

### **Example:**
Creating an **E-commerce Website**
1. First Increment: Homepage + Product Listing.
2. Second Increment: Shopping Cart + Payment.
3. Third Increment: User Reviews + Discounts.
4. Fourth Increment: Admin Panel.

### **Advantages:**
- Customer feedback is received early.
- Reduces risk as parts are tested frequently.

### **Problems:**
- Difficult to track progress.
- Software structure may degrade over time.

## **Integration and Configuration (Using Ready-Made Components)**
Instead of building everything from scratch, this model **uses existing software modules** and customizes them.

### **Example:**
Creating a **Hospital Management System** using:
1. Pre-built **billing** software.
2. Pre-built **appointment booking** system.
3. Custom-built **patient records** module.

### **Advantages:**
- Faster development.
- Lower risk of failure.

### **Disadvantages:**
- Limited customization.
- Software may not meet all requirements.

## **Software Development Process Activities**
### **1. Software Specification (What should the software do?)**
Before creating software, we must **define what it should do**. This is called **Requirements Engineering**.

**Example:**
Creating a **Food Delivery App**
- The user should be able to **browse restaurants**.
- The user should be able to **place an order**.
- The user should be able to **track the delivery**.

### **2. System Analysis (Understanding the System)**
**System Analysis** means understanding the existing system and its requirements.

**Example:**
A bank wants a **new online banking system**. System analysis includes:
- Studying the current banking system.
- Identifying areas for improvement.
- Creating diagrams to visualize the process.

### **3. Software Design (How should the software work?)**
In **Software Design**, we plan how different parts of the software will interact.

#### **Key Design Activities:**
- **Architectural Design** – What are the major components?
- **Database Design** – How will data be stored?
- **User Interface Design** – How will the user interact with the software?

### **4. System Development (Building the Software)**
Once the design is complete, **developers start coding** the software.

**Example:**
For a **Hotel Booking System**, developers will:
- Write code for **searching rooms**.
- Write code for **booking a room**.
- Write code for **sending confirmation emails**.

### **5. System Validation (Testing the Software)**
Testing ensures the software **works correctly**.

#### **Testing Stages:**
1. **Module Testing** – Testing individual parts.
2. **Integration Testing** – Testing how different parts work together.
3. **System Testing** – Testing the whole system.
4. **User Testing** – Testing with real users.

### **Example of System Testing:**
For an **Online Exam System**:
- Test if students can **log in**.
- Test if students can **answer questions**.
- Test if the system **calculates scores correctly**.

### **6. System Evolution (Updating Software Over Time)**
Software needs **regular updates** as new technology emerges.

### **Why Do We Change Software?**
- **New Business Needs** – A company may want to **add a chatbot**.
- **New Technologies** – A website may need to be **optimized for mobile**.
- **User Demands** – Users may want **dark mode**.

### **Example:**
A **Social Media App** may start as just text posts but later **add video sharing**.

## **Software Prototyping (Quickly Building a Sample)**
A **prototype** is a **rough version** of the software to test ideas.

### **Example:**
Before developing a **Car Rental App**, a basic prototype is built where:
- Users can **search for cars**.
- Users can **book a car**.
- Users **cannot** make payments (yet).

### **Benefits of Prototypes:**
- Helps understand what users really want.
- Saves time and money by preventing mistakes.

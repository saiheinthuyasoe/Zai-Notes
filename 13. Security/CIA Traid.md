### **1. Confidentiality**

**Meaning:**
Keeping information **private and secret**. Only people who are allowed to see it should have access.

**Example:**
When you log in to your email, only **you** should see your messages — not anyone else.
👉 Using a **password** or **encryption** helps keep your data confidential.

### **2. Integrity**

**Meaning:**
Making sure information is **accurate and not changed** by accident or on purpose.

**Example:**
If a bank transfers $100 from your account to another, the amount should not change to $1,000 or $10 during the process.
👉 Using **checksums** or **digital signatures** ensures data stays correct.

---

### **3. Availability**

**Meaning:**
Information and systems should be **available and working** when needed.

**Example:**
When you open a website or use an online service, it should load quickly and not be down.
👉 Using **backups**, **servers**, and **security updates** keeps systems running.

✅ **In short:**

- **Confidentiality** → Keep it **secret**
- **Integrity** → Keep it **correct**
- **Availability** → Keep it **accessible**

# data + metadata = information

Here's how it works:

- **Data** is just raw facts (like numbers, names, or measurements) that on their own may not be very meaningful.
- **Metadata** provides extra context or descriptions about the data (like its source, format, or structure).

When you combine both, you get **information** that is organized, understood, and useful.

### Example:
Let’s say you have this data:

- Data: "2024-11-20, 25°C, Sunny"

Now, if we add some **metadata** (extra information about the data):

- Metadata:  
  - **Source**: "Weather API"  
  - **Location**: "Paris"  
  - **Time of day**: "12:00 PM"

Together, the data and metadata become **information**:

- **Information**: "The weather in Paris on November 20, 2024, at 12:00 PM is 25°C and sunny."

Now, the **data** (temperature and date) makes sense and is useful because the **metadata** (location, time, source) provides context.

### Simple Summary:
- **Data** + **Metadata** = **Information** (data that is organized and meaningful).

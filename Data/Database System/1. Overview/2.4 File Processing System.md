# File Processing system

A **file processing system** is an older way of managing and organizing data using individual files stored on a computer. Each file is created and maintained separately, usually for a specific purpose, and there’s no centralized system to manage the data as a whole.

### Characteristics of a File Processing System:
1. **Data Storage**:
   - Data is stored in flat files (like `.txt` or `.csv`).
   - Each file contains structured or unstructured data for specific applications.

2. **No Central Management**:
   - Files are managed separately, often by individual applications.
   - There is no centralized database to coordinate access or updates.

3. **Redundancy**:
   - The same data might be stored in multiple files because there’s no sharing mechanism.

4. **Manual Integration**:
   - Combining data from multiple files often requires manual effort or custom scripts.

5. **Limited Functionality**:
   - Operations like searching, updating, or querying data across files can be slow and inefficient.

### Example:
Imagine a small business storing customer and order data:
- Customer information is in a file called `customers.txt`.
- Order details are in a file called `orders.txt`.
- If you want to match customer names with their orders, you’d need to manually cross-reference the files or write a script.

### **Limitations of File Processing Systems**:
1. **Data Redundancy**: Duplicate copies of the same data across multiple files.
2. **Data Inconsistency**: If data is updated in one file but not in another, it leads to mismatched information.
3. **Lack of Security**: Files are harder to protect from unauthorized access.
4. **No Multi-User Access**: Difficult to handle multiple users accessing or modifying files simultaneously.
5. **Limited Scalability**: Not suitable for managing large volumes of data.

### Why Modern Systems Use Databases Instead:
Databases solve many of these issues by:
- Centralizing data.
- Reducing redundancy and inconsistency.
- Supporting fast and complex queries.
- Allowing multiple users to work simultaneously with data.

### **Superkey**

A **superkey** is any combination of attributes (columns) in a table that can uniquely identify a row in that table. It can include extra attributes that aren't strictly necessary to ensure uniqueness.

- **Example**: In a table of students:
  - **Attributes**: `StudentID`, `Name`, `Email`
  - Superkeys:
    - `{StudentID}`
    - `{StudentID, Name}`
    - `{StudentID, Email}`

Any set containing `StudentID` is a superkey because `StudentID` alone can uniquely identify a row.

---

### **Candidate Key**

A **candidate key** is a minimal superkey. It is a superkey with no unnecessary attributes.

- **Example**:
  - From the above example, `{StudentID}` is a **candidate key** because it is minimal and uniquely identifies a row.
  - `{StudentID, Name}` is **not** a candidate key because `Name` is unnecessary.

A table can have multiple candidate keys. For instance, `{Email}` could also be a candidate key if each email is unique.

---

### **Primary Key**

The **primary key** is one of the candidate keys chosen to uniquely identify rows in the table. It cannot have `NULL` values.

- **Example**:
  - From the candidate keys `{StudentID}` and `{Email}`, if we select `StudentID` as the primary key, it will be the official identifier for the rows.

---

### **Foreign Key**

A **foreign key** is an attribute (or set of attributes) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.

- **Example**:

  - **Student Table**:  
    | `StudentID` (Primary Key) | `Name` |  
    |---------------------------|---------|  
    | 1 | Alice |  
    | 2 | Bob |

  - **Enrollment Table**:  
    | `EnrollmentID` | `StudentID` (Foreign Key) | `Course` |  
    |-----------------|--------------------------|----------|  
    | 101 | 1 | Math |  
    | 102 | 2 | Science |

In the **Enrollment Table**, `StudentID` is a foreign key referencing the `StudentID` in the **Student Table**.

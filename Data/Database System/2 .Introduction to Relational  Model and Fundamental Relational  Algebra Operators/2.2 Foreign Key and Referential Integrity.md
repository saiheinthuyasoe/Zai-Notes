# **Foreign Key and Referential Integrity: Simple Explanation**

#### **What is a Foreign Key?**

A **Foreign Key** is a column (or a set of columns) in a table that creates a link between two tables. It points to the **Primary Key** of another table, which helps maintain a relationship between the two tables.

- **Foreign Key** ensures that the value in one table (called the **child table**) matches a value in the primary key column of another table (called the **parent table**).
- This helps make sure that data is consistent and related properly across tables.

### **What is Referential Integrity?**

**Referential Integrity** is a rule that ensures the relationship between tables remains consistent. It means that if a foreign key exists in a table, the value in that foreign key column must match a value in the **primary key** of the other table.

- If you have a foreign key in a table, it **must** point to an existing record in the other table. You can't have a foreign key that refers to a non-existing record.

### **Simple Example:**

Letâ€™s use a **Customers** table and an **Orders** table.

#### **1. Customers Table**:

This table stores information about customers, with a **primary key** `customer_id` which uniquely identifies each customer.

| customer_id (Primary Key) | customer_name |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1                         | John Doe      |
| 2                         | Jane Smith    |
| 3                         | Jim Brown     |

#### **2. Orders Table**:

This table stores information about customer orders, with a **foreign key** `customer_id` that links to the `customer_id` in the **Customers** table.

| order_id | order_date | customer_id (Foreign Key) |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| 101      | 2024-11-01 | 1                         |
| 102      | 2024-11-02 | 2                         |
| 103      | 2024-11-03 | 3                         |

- The **foreign key** `customer_id` in the **Orders** table refers to the `customer_id` in the **Customers** table.

#### **Referential Integrity in Action:**

- The **foreign key** constraint ensures that any `customer_id` in the **Orders** table must match an existing `customer_id` in the **Customers** table.
- **If you try to insert a record into the Orders table with a `customer_id` that does not exist in the Customers table, the database will reject the insertion.**

### **In Simple Terms**:

- **Foreign Key**: It's a column in one table that points to the **Primary Key** of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.
- **Referential Integrity**: It ensures that the relationship between tables is valid. A foreign key must point to an existing primary key in another table.

### **Example in SQL**:

```sql
-- Creating the Customers table (with Primary Key)
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Creating the Orders table (with Foreign Key)
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
```

- **Referential Integrity** ensures that each order must be linked to a valid customer. You can't insert an order with a `customer_id` of `4` if there is no customer with that ID in the **Customers** table.

---

### **Summary**:

- **Foreign Key**: A column that connects one table to another via a primary key.
- **Referential Integrity**: A rule that ensures the foreign key always points to an existing record in the referenced table, preventing invalid relationships.

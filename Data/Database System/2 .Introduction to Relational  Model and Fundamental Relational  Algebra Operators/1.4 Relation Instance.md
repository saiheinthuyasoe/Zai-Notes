# What is a Relation Instance?

- A **Relation Instance** is the **current set of data (tuples)** in a relation (table) at a particular point in time.
- It represents the **snapshot of the data** stored in the table at a specific time.

---

### Key Points:

1. **Instance at a Time**:

   - At different points in time, the same table (relation) may have different data. These are different **instances** of the same relation.

2. **Unordered Nature**:
   - The rows (tuples) in a relation are **unordered**, meaning the order of rows does not matter in determining whether two instances are the same.

### Simple Example:

Letâ€™s consider a **Customer Table** with attributes: `customer_name`, `customer_street`, and `customer_city`.

#### Instance at **Time t1**:

| customer_name | customer_street | customer_city |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Jones         | Main            | Harrison      |
| Smith         | North           | Rye           |
| Curry         | North           | Rye           |
| Lindsay       | Park            | Pittsfield    |

#### Instance at **Time t2**:

| customer_name | customer_street | customer_city |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Jones         | Green           | Main          |
| Smith         | Williams        | North         |
| Turner        | Putnam          | Stamford      |
| Lindsay       | Park            | Pittsfield    |

### Explanation:

1. **Relation Instance**:

   - At **time t1**, the table contains 4 rows with specific data (an instance of the relation).
   - At **time t2**, the data in the table has changed (a new instance of the same relation).

2. **Are the Instances the Same?**
   - No, the instances are different because the rows and values are not identical between **t1** and **t2**.

---

### Key Concept: **Unordered Nature**:

- Even if the rows in a table are arranged differently, the instance is still the same as long as the data is identical.
- Example:
  - Instance 1:  
    | A | B |  
    |---|---|  
    | 1 | 2 |  
    | 3 | 4 |
  - Instance 2:  
    | A | B |  
    |---|---|  
    | 3 | 4 |  
    | 1 | 2 |
  - These are the **same instance** because they contain the same tuples, just in a different order.

---

### Summary:

A **relation instance** is the **current state of the data** in a table.

- Instances change over time as data is added, updated, or deleted.
- The order of rows does not affect whether two instances are the same.

- **Note** Relations are unordered

# Identify Keys

To determine **superkey**, **candidate key**, and **primary key**, you can follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Identify Superkeys**

A **superkey** is any combination of attributes that can uniquely identify each row in a table.

- **Steps**:
  1. Look at the table and determine all combinations of columns that ensure **uniqueness** (i.e., no two rows will have the same value for these columns).
  2. Include unnecessary attributes (this is allowed for a superkey).
- **Example**:
  - Table: `Student(StudentID, Name, Email)`
  - Unique combinations (superkeys):
    - `{StudentID}`
    - `{StudentID, Name}`
    - `{StudentID, Email}`
    - `{StudentID, Name, Email}`
    - `{Email}` (if `Email` is unique for every student)

### 2. **Identify Candidate Keys**

A **candidate key** is a **minimal** superkey, meaning:

- It must uniquely identify rows.
- It must not contain any extra/unnecessary attributes.

- **Steps**:

  1. Start with each superkey.
  2. Remove unnecessary attributes (attributes that aren’t required to guarantee uniqueness).
  3. You’re left with **candidate keys**.

- **Example**:
  - From the superkeys `{StudentID}`, `{StudentID, Name}`, `{StudentID, Email}`:
    - `{StudentID}` is minimal (no extra attributes).
    - `{Email}` is also minimal if it's unique.
  - **Candidate Keys**: `{StudentID}`, `{Email}`.

### 3. **Choose the Primary Key**

A **primary key** is chosen from the **candidate keys**.

- **Steps**:

  1. Choose one candidate key to act as the primary key. The decision is typically based on:
     - Simplicity: Prefer the attribute that is easiest to manage (e.g., a numeric ID over a long text).
     - Stability: Pick an attribute unlikely to change (e.g., `StudentID` over `Email`).
     - System/Business Requirements: The organization may specify which attribute to use.
  2. Ensure the primary key does not allow `NULL` values.

- **Example**:
  - From `{StudentID}` and `{Email}`, choose:
    - `{StudentID}` as the **Primary Key** because:
      - It’s a simple numeric value.
      - It’s unlikely to change (compared to `Email`, which could change).

---

### Summary of the Decision Process:

1. **Superkey**: Any set of attributes that uniquely identifies rows.  
   Example: `{StudentID}`, `{StudentID, Name}`, `{StudentID, Email}`.
2. **Candidate Key**: Minimal superkeys that still uniquely identify rows.  
   Example: `{StudentID}`, `{Email}`.

3. **Primary Key**: A chosen candidate key, based on simplicity, stability, or business needs.  
   Example: `{StudentID}`.

By analyzing the table structure and understanding the data, you can systematically classify attributes into superkey, candidate key, and primary key.

# What is a Relation Schema?

- **Relation Schema** defines the **structure of a relation (table)** in a database.
- It includes:
  - **Attributes**: The column names (e.g., `customer_name`, `customer_street`, etc.).
  - **Definition of the Relation**: The name of the table (e.g., `Customer`).
  - **Constraints**: Rules like primary keys, foreign keys, or other integrity rules.

---

### Key Components:
1. **Attributes**: The columns in the table (e.g., `customer_name`, `customer_street`, `customer_city`).
2. **Schema Definition**: Specifies the structure as a combination of all attributes.
3. **Relation**: The actual table that contains rows conforming to the schema.

### Example:

Letâ€™s define a **relation schema** for a **Customer** table:

- **Relation Schema**:  
  `Customer_schema = (customer_name, customer_street, customer_city)`

- **Relation r(Customer_schema)**:  
  The actual **table** created based on the schema:

| customer_name | customer_street | customer_city |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Jones         | Main            | Harrison      |
| Smith         | North           | Rye           |
| Curry         | North           | Rye           |
| Lindsay       | Park            | Pittsfield    |

### Explanation of the Example:
1. **Relation Schema**:  
   - The schema of the `Customer` relation is defined as:  
     `Customer_schema = (customer_name, customer_street, customer_city)`  
     This means the table has **three attributes**: `customer_name`, `customer_street`, and `customer_city`.

2. **Relation**:  
   - The **relation** `Customer` is a table containing rows (tuples) that conform to the schema `Customer_schema`.

---

### Key Points:
- The **schema** defines the **structure** of the table (the columns and their constraints).  
- The **relation** is the **data** stored in the table that follows the schema.  
- Example relation: The actual table data like names, streets, and cities.

This makes it easier to understand how the database organizes and enforces rules for data consistency.

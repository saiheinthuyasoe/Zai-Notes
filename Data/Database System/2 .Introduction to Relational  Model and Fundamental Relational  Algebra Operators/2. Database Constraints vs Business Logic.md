# 2. Database Constraints vs Business Logic

### **Database Constraints vs Business Logic**

1. **Database Constraints**:

   - These are **rules** defined at the database level to ensure the data is valid, accurate, and consistent.
   - Constraints are enforced by the database system itself.

   - **Example**:
     - A column `customer_age` must be an integer between 1 and 199.
     - The database enforces this rule, so invalid data (like negative numbers or strings) cannot be inserted into that column.

---

2. **Business Logic**:

   - These are the **rules specific to the business** or organization. They define how data should behave in a specific scenario.
   - Business logic is **broader** than database constraints and may not always be enforceable directly by the database.

   - **Example**:
     - Customers under the age of 18 are not allowed to open an account.
     - This rule is a business-specific decision, not something the database inherently understands without extra logic.

---

### **Relationship Between Them**

- The **schema of the database** defines **constraints** that enforce **some aspects of business logic**, but it cannot cover all possible business rules.
- **Database Constraints** help enforce structural and basic rules about the data.
- **Business Logic** includes complex rules that often require additional processing, like application-level checks.

### **Examples**

#### **1. Database Constraint Example**

| Attribute      | Domain Specification                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `customer_age` | Integer value between 1 and 199               |
| `email`        | Must be unique (no duplicate emails allowed)  |
| `account_type` | Must be one of: "savings", "checking", "loan" |

These constraints ensure:

- You can't insert invalid ages like `-5` or `250`.
- You can't add two customers with the same `email`.
- `account_type` can only have specific predefined values.

#### **2. Business Logic Example**

| Business Rule                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customers below 18 cannot open a bank account.          |
| Savings account balance must not go below $100.         |
| Customers cannot have more than 3 active loan accounts. |

- These rules are **business-specific** and often require more complex checks that go beyond simple database constraints.
- For example:
  - To check if a customer has more than 3 active loans, you'd need to write a query or application code to count their loans.

### **Key Difference**

| **Database Constraints**                    | **Business Logic**                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enforced at the database level.             | Defined in business rules, enforced by code or policy. |
| Focuses on ensuring valid, consistent data. | Focuses on business-specific operations and behaviors. |
| Examples: Data types, ranges, uniqueness.   | Examples: Eligibility, calculations, workflows.        |

### Summary in Simple Terms

- **Database Constraints** are like guardrails to keep your data clean and valid.
- **Business Logic** is how the business decides what to do with the data (e.g., who can open an account, what happens if a balance drops, etc.). Some of it can be enforced by the database, but often, it needs extra code outside the database.

# Lgoical Model

The **Logical Model** is a more detailed design of the database that focuses on how the data will be structured and related without considering the specific software or technology used (i.e., it’s independent of the database management system). It defines **tables**, **fields** (columns), and **relationships** between them.

### Simple Explanation:
- A **logical model** translates the **high-level conceptual design** (like the ER diagram) into specific **tables** and **relationships**. 
- It ensures that data is **organized in a logical and consistent way** so it can be stored and accessed efficiently.

### Simple Example:
Let’s take the example of an **online store database**.

1. **Conceptual Model** (High-level):
   - **Entities**: 
     - Customer
     - Product
     - Order

2. **Logical Model** (More Detailed):
   - **Tables**:
     - **Customers Table**: Stores details about customers.
     - **Products Table**: Stores details about products.
     - **Orders Table**: Stores details about orders placed by customers.

3. **Details in the Logical Model**:
   - **Customers Table**:
     - Columns: **CustomerID**, **Name**, **Email**
   - **Products Table**:
     - Columns: **ProductID**, **ProductName**, **Price**
   - **Orders Table**:
     - Columns: **OrderID**, **CustomerID**, **ProductID**, **Quantity**

4. **Relationships**:
   - Each **Order** is associated with one **Customer** (via **CustomerID**).
   - Each **Order** contains one or more **Products** (via **ProductID**).

   In the **Logical Model**, we define the **foreign keys** to link tables:
   - The **Orders Table** will have **CustomerID** (foreign key) to reference the **Customers Table**.
   - The **Orders Table** will have **ProductID** (foreign key) to reference the **Products Table**.

### Tables in the Logical Model:

#### 1. **Customers Table**:
| CustomerID | Name        | Email               |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1          | John Smith  | john@example.com    |
| 2          | Jane Doe    | jane@example.com    |

#### 2. **Products Table**:
| ProductID | ProductName | Price |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1         | T-shirt     | 15    |
| 2         | Jeans       | 40    |

#### 3. **Orders Table**:
| OrderID | CustomerID | ProductID | Quantity |
|---------|------------|-----------|----------|
| 1       | 1          | 1         | 2        |
| 2       | 2          | 2         | 1        |

### Key Points of the Logical Model:
- **Tables** represent different entities (e.g., Customers, Products, Orders).
- **Columns** represent the attributes (e.g., Name, Price).
- **Relationships** between tables are defined using **foreign keys** (e.g., linking Customers with Orders).
  
### In Simple Terms:
The **Logical Model** is the step where we define **how the data will be organized** into tables and **how tables will relate** to each other, but we are not concerned yet about how the data will be physically stored or what technology will be used. It’s like planning the structure of a building before you start construction.

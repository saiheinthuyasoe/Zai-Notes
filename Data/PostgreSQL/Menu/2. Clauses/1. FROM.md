# FROM

The **`FROM`** clause in SQL specifies the table (or tables) from which to retrieve data. In PostgreSQL and other SQL databases, the `FROM` clause is essential in a `SELECT` query, as it tells the database where to look for the data you want to retrieve.

### Basic Syntax of `FROM`

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
[ORDER BY column_name];
```

- **`SELECT column1, column2, ...`**: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve.
- **`FROM table_name`**: Specifies the table where those columns are located.

### Basic Example of `FROM`

Assume we have a table called `employees`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  department_id INT,
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

#### 1. **Simple SELECT with FROM**

To retrieve all rows and columns from the `employees` table:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees;
```

- This retrieves every column for each row in the `employees` table.

#### 2. **Selecting Specific Columns from a Table**

You can use `FROM` to specify the table and list only certain columns to retrieve:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees;
```

- This command retrieves only the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `salary` columns for each employee.

---

### Using `FROM` with Aliases

Table aliases are temporary names for tables in a query. Aliases can make queries more readable, especially when using multiple tables or long table names.

#### 3. **Using a Table Alias**

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary
FROM employees AS e;
```

- `AS e` gives the `employees` table an alias (`e`). Now, `e` can be used as a shorthand to refer to the `employees` table throughout the query.

#### 4. **Using Aliases with Multiple Tables**

Assume we also have a `departments` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
  department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

We can join `employees` with `departments` using aliases for easier reference:

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees AS e
JOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

- This query joins `employees` and `departments` and uses aliases `e` and `d` for better readability.

---

### Using `FROM` with Multiple Tables and JOINs

The `FROM` clause can include multiple tables, typically with `JOIN` operations to combine related data across tables.

#### 5. **Using INNER JOIN in FROM Clause**

An **INNER JOIN** returns rows that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

- This command joins `employees` and `departments` based on `department_id`.
- Only employees with a matching department in the `departments` table are returned.

#### 6. **LEFT JOIN in FROM Clause**

A **LEFT JOIN** returns all rows from the left table (`employees`), and matching rows from the right table (`departments`). If there is no match, `NULL` is returned for columns from the right table.

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

- This query retrieves all employees, with department names if available. If an employee has no department, `department_name` will be `NULL`.

---

### Using `FROM` with Subqueries

You can use a subquery (also known as a derived table) within the `FROM` clause to create a temporary table for further querying.

#### 7. **Using a Subquery in the FROM Clause**

Suppose we want to find employees who earn more than the average salary. We can use a subquery to calculate the average salary and then reference it.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

Or, we can use a subquery as a temporary table:

```sql
SELECT high_earners.first_name, high_earners.salary
FROM (SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000) AS high_earners;
```

- In this example, the subquery `(SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000)` is treated as a table named `high_earners`.

---

### Using `FROM` with Multiple Joins

The `FROM` clause can include multiple joins to combine data from more than two tables.

#### 8. **Joining Three Tables with FROM**

Let’s add a `projects` table and retrieve data across all three tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
  project_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  project_name VARCHAR(100),
  department_id INT
);
```

Now, let’s find the employees, their departments, and the projects they are working on:

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name, p.project_name
FROM employees AS e
JOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
JOIN projects AS p ON d.department_id = p.department_id;
```

- This query retrieves each employee, their department, and the project associated with their department.
- **Result**: Only rows where all tables have matching data are included in the output.

---

### Using `FROM` with Self-Joins

A **self-join** is a join of a table with itself, useful for comparing rows within the same table.

#### 9. **Self-Join Example**

Suppose we want to find pairs of employees who work in the same department:

```sql
SELECT e1.first_name AS employee1, e2.first_name AS employee2, e1.department_id
FROM employees AS e1
JOIN employees AS e2 ON e1.department_id = e2.department_id
WHERE e1.employee_id < e2.employee_id;
```

- Here, we use aliases `e1` and `e2` to reference the `employees` table twice.
- The `WHERE` clause ensures we don’t pair the same employee with themselves and only lists each pair once.

---

### Using `FROM` with CROSS JOIN

A **CROSS JOIN** returns the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.

#### 10. **CROSS JOIN Example**

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees AS e
CROSS JOIN departments AS d;
```

- This query combines each employee with every department, regardless of whether they’re in that department.
- Be cautious with `CROSS JOIN`, as it can produce a large result set.

---

### Summary of `FROM` Usage

- **Basic Querying**: Specifies the table from which data is retrieved.
- **Table Aliases**: Use aliases to simplify references, especially in complex queries.
- **JOINs**: Combine data from multiple tables with `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`, and `CROSS JOIN`.
- **Subqueries**: Treat a subquery as a temporary table for advanced filtering and aggregation.
- **Self-Joins**: Compare rows within the same table by using aliases.

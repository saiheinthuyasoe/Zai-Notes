# ORDER BY

The **`ORDER BY`** clause in SQL is used to sort the result set of a query based on one or more columns. In PostgreSQL, as well as in other SQL databases, `ORDER BY` is commonly used to organize data in ascending or descending order, making it easier to analyze or view data in a logical sequence.

### Basic Syntax of `ORDER BY`

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC];
```

- **`column1`, `column2`, ...**: The columns you want to retrieve from the table.
- **`table_name`**: The name of the table you are querying.
- **`ORDER BY column_name`**: Specifies the column(s) to sort by.
- **`ASC`**: Sorts in ascending order (default if not specified).
- **`DESC`**: Sorts in descending order.

### Basic Examples of `ORDER BY`

Assume we have a table called `employees`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
  hire_date DATE
);
```

#### 1. **Ordering in Ascending Order (Default)**

If you want to sort employees by their salary in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary;
```

- This will return the list of employees with the lowest salaries appearing first and the highest salaries at the bottom.
- **Note**: Ascending order is the default sorting order, so `ASC` is optional.

#### 2. **Ordering in Descending Order**

To list employees with the highest salaries first, use `DESC`:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

- This command sorts the `salary` column in descending order, with the highest salaries at the top.

---

### Ordering by Multiple Columns

You can sort by more than one column by listing multiple columns in the `ORDER BY` clause. The rows are first sorted by the first column, and within that order, theyâ€™re sorted by the second column.

#### 3. **Ordering by Multiple Columns (Primary and Secondary Sorting)**

Suppose you want to order employees by `last_name` in ascending order, and within each `last_name`, sort by `first_name` in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;
```

- This query will return employees in alphabetical order by `last_name`. If two employees have the same `last_name`, they will be further sorted by `first_name`.

#### 4. **Mixing ASC and DESC in Multiple Columns**

If you want to list employees in descending order of `salary`, but in case of ties, sort them by `hire_date` in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, hire_date
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC, hire_date ASC;
```

- This command lists employees with the highest salary first. If two employees have the same salary, the one hired earlier appears first.

### Ordering with Null Values

In PostgreSQL, `NULL` values are treated as the lowest possible values by default when sorting in ascending order and as the highest in descending order. You can control the placement of `NULL` values with `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`.

#### 5. **Ordering with NULLS FIRST**

To place `NULL` values at the top:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary ASC NULLS FIRST;
```

- This command lists all employees with `NULL` in the `salary` column first, followed by those with actual salary values in ascending order.

#### 6. **Ordering with NULLS LAST**

To place `NULL` values at the bottom:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary ASC NULLS LAST;
```

- This command lists all employees with valid salary values in ascending order, followed by those with `NULL` in the `salary` column.

### Using `ORDER BY` with Aggregate Functions

You can use `ORDER BY` with aggregate functions (like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) to sort grouped data.

#### 7. **Ordering by Aggregate Function Results**

Suppose we want to calculate the total salary per department and order the departments by the total salary in descending order:

```sql
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY total_salary DESC;
```

- This command calculates the total salary per department and sorts the departments from the highest to the lowest total salary.

---

### Using `ORDER BY` with Aliases

You can use column aliases in `ORDER BY` to make queries more readable, especially when using calculated columns.

#### 8. **Ordering by Aliased Column**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary * 1.1 AS increased_salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY increased_salary DESC;
```

- Here, `increased_salary` is an alias for `salary * 1.1`. The query sorts employees based on their `increased_salary` in descending order.

---

### Using `ORDER BY` with Expressions

You can sort results based on expressions or calculated values.

#### 9. **Ordering by Calculated Values**

Suppose you want to order employees by their salary after adding a 10% bonus:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, (salary * 1.10) AS total_compensation
FROM employees
ORDER BY total_compensation DESC;
```

- This query orders employees based on their total compensation after applying a 10% bonus.

---

### Using `ORDER BY` with LIMIT

The `ORDER BY` clause is often combined with `LIMIT` to get the top or bottom records, such as the highest-paid employees or the most recent hires.

#### 10. **Getting the Top N Results**

To find the top 5 highest-paid employees:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

- This query sorts employees by salary in descending order and limits the result to the top 5 rows.

#### 11. **Getting the Bottom N Results**

To find the 5 employees with the lowest salaries:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

- This query sorts employees by salary in ascending order and returns only the lowest 5 salaries.

---

### Ordering Results in Views

You can create views with `ORDER BY` to store sorted query results as a virtual table.

#### 12. **Creating a View with ORDER BY**

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

- This view `high_salary_employees` stores a sorted list of employees earning above $50,000 in descending order by salary.

---

### Summary of `ORDER BY`

- **Basic Sorting**: `ORDER BY column_name` sorts by a single column in ascending or descending order.
- **Multi-Column Sorting**: Sort by multiple columns for complex sorting requirements.
- **Handling NULLs**: Control the placement of `NULL` values using `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`.
- **With Aggregate Functions**: Sort grouped results based on aggregate calculations.
- **With Aliases and Expressions**: Use calculated fields and aliases for sorting.
- **With LIMIT**: Combine with `LIMIT` to get top or bottom records.

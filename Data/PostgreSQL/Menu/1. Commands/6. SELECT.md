# SELECT

The **`SELECT`** statement is one of the most commonly used SQL commands in PostgreSQL and other relational databases. It retrieves data from one or more tables and is the foundation of SQL querying. With `SELECT`, you can specify which columns to fetch, filter records, sort results, group data, and perform calculations.

---

### Basic Syntax of `SELECT`

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
[ORDER BY column ASC|DESC]
[LIMIT number];
```

- **`column1`, `column2`, ...**: The names of the columns you want to retrieve.
- **`table_name`**: The name of the table you are querying.
- **`WHERE`**: Filters rows based on a condition.
- **`ORDER BY`**: Sorts the result set by one or more columns, in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
- **`LIMIT`**: Restricts the number of rows returned.

---

### Basic Examples of `SELECT`

Assume we have a table called `employees`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
  hire_date DATE
);
```

#### 1. **Selecting All Columns**

To retrieve all columns in the table, use `*`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

- This retrieves every column for each row in the `employees` table.

#### 2. **Selecting Specific Columns**

To retrieve only specific columns, list them explicitly:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees;
```

- This command returns only the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `salary` columns for each employee.

---

### Using `WHERE` for Filtering Data

The `WHERE` clause filters the rows returned by the `SELECT` statement based on a condition.

#### 3. **Filtering by a Simple Condition**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

- This retrieves only employees with a `salary` greater than $50,000.

#### 4. **Using Multiple Conditions with AND/OR**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000 AND hire_date < '2022-01-01';
```

- This returns employees who have a `salary` above $50,000 **and** were hired before January 1, 2022.

#### 5. **Using Pattern Matching with `LIKE`**

The `LIKE` operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com';
```

- This returns employees whose email ends with `@example.com`.
- `%` is a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters.

---

### Sorting Results with `ORDER BY`

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the rows returned by the query.

#### 6. **Sorting in Ascending or Descending Order**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

- This retrieves all employees and sorts them by `salary` in descending order, with the highest salaries at the top.

---

### Limiting Results with `LIMIT`

The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned.

#### 7. **Limit the Number of Results**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

- This query retrieves the 5 most recently hired employees.

---

### Using Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single result. Common aggregate functions include `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, and `MIN`.

#### 8. **Counting Rows with `COUNT`**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
```

- This returns the total number of rows (employees) in the `employees` table.

#### 9. **Calculating the Average with `AVG`**

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
```

- This calculates the average salary of all employees.

#### 10. **Using Multiple Aggregate Functions**

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary, MAX(salary) AS highest_salary FROM employees;
```

- This returns the minimum and maximum salary among employees.

---

### Grouping Results with `GROUP BY`

The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns, commonly used with aggregate functions.

#### 11. **Grouping by Department**

Assume we have a `department` column in the `employees` table:

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

- This query calculates the average salary for each department.

#### 12. **Filtering Groups with `HAVING`**

The `HAVING` clause filters groups after aggregation (similar to `WHERE`, but for groups).

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;
```

- This returns departments with an average salary greater than $60,000.

---

### Joining Tables

`JOIN` clauses allow you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

#### 13. **Using an Inner Join**

Suppose we have another table called `departments`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
  department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

We can join `employees` with `departments` based on a common `department_id` column.

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

- This query retrieves employees along with their department names.

#### 14. **Using Left Join**

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

- This retrieves all employees, including those without a matching department. For those without a match, `department_name` will be `NULL`.

---

### Using Subqueries

A subquery is a query nested inside another query, which can be used to filter or calculate values.

#### 15. **Subquery in `WHERE` Clause**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

- This retrieves employees whose salary is above the company-wide average.

---

### Aliases for Columns and Tables

Aliases allow you to assign a temporary name to columns or tables, making them easier to reference.

#### 16. **Using Column Aliases**

```sql
SELECT first_name AS fname, last_name AS lname FROM employees;
```

- This renames `first_name` to `fname` and `last_name` to `lname` in the result.

#### 17. **Using Table Aliases**

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees AS e
JOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

- This query uses `e` as an alias for `employees` and `d` for `departments`.

---

### Advanced `SELECT` Statements

#### 18. **Selecting Distinct Values**

The `DISTINCT` keyword removes duplicate rows from the result set.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
```

- This retrieves unique department names from the `employees` table.

#### 19. **Combining Results with `UNION`**

`UNION` combines results from two or more `SELECT` statements, removing duplicates.

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT first_name FROM archived_employees;
```

- This retrieves unique first names from both `employees` and `archived_employees`.

#### 20. **Window Functions**

Window functions calculate values across a set of table rows related to the current row.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

- This assigns a ranking to each employee based on salary, with the highest salary ranked first.

### Summary of `SELECT` Usage

- **Basic Retrieval**: Use `SELECT column_name FROM table_name` to fetch specific columns.
- **Filtering**: Use `WHERE` to filter rows and `HAVING` to filter groups.
- **Sorting**: Use `ORDER BY` to sort the results.
- **Grouping**: Use `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions to group data.
- **Joining**: Use `JOIN` clauses to combine data from multiple tables.
- **Subqueries**: Use subqueries to create more complex conditions.
- **Aggregates**: Use functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` for calculations.
- **Window Functions**: Perform calculations across related rows with `OVER`.

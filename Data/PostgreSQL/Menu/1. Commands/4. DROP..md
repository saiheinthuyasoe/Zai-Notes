# DROP

The **`DROP`** command in SQL is used to delete database objects like tables, indexes, views, databases, schemas, and other objects permanently. In PostgreSQL, the `DROP` command is an irreversible operation, meaning that once an object is dropped, it cannot be recovered unless there is a backup.

### Key Characteristics of `DROP`

1. **Irreversible**: `DROP` permanently removes the object and all data contained within it.
2. **Cascade and Restrict Options**: You can specify how `DROP` should handle dependent objects with `CASCADE` or `RESTRICT`.
3. **No Undo**: Unlike `TRUNCATE` or `DELETE`, `DROP` doesn’t allow rollback for the data it deletes outside of a transactional block.
4. **Cascading Effects**: Dropping an object can affect other objects, especially if they depend on the one being dropped.

### Basic Syntax of `DROP`

```sql
DROP object_type object_name [CASCADE | RESTRICT];
```

- **object_type**: The type of object to drop (e.g., `TABLE`, `DATABASE`, `INDEX`, `VIEW`).
- **object_name**: The name of the object to be dropped.
- **CASCADE**: Automatically drops objects that depend on the object being dropped.
- **RESTRICT**: Refuses to drop the object if there are any dependencies. This is the default behavior.

### 1. **Dropping a Table**

The `DROP TABLE` command removes a table and all its data from the database.

**Syntax**:
```sql
DROP TABLE table_name [CASCADE | RESTRICT];
```

**Example**:
```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```

- This command permanently deletes the `employees` table and all data within it.
- If other tables have foreign key relationships with `employees`, you’ll need to use `CASCADE` to drop those dependent objects as well.

**Example with `CASCADE`**:
```sql
DROP TABLE orders CASCADE;
```

- Using `CASCADE` will also drop any foreign key constraints or dependencies linked to the `orders` table.

---

### 2. **Dropping a Database**

The `DROP DATABASE` command deletes an entire database, including all tables, indexes, and other objects within it.

**Syntax**:
```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

**Example**:
```sql
DROP DATABASE company_db;
```

- This command deletes the `company_db` database entirely.
- You cannot drop a database while connected to it, so you must switch to a different database before executing this command.

**Note**: Use this command with caution, as it removes all data and structures in the specified database.

---

### 3. **Dropping a Column**

You can use the `DROP COLUMN` command within `ALTER TABLE` to delete a specific column from a table.

**Syntax**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name [CASCADE | RESTRICT];
```

**Example**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP COLUMN phone_number;
```

- This command permanently removes the `phone_number` column from the `employees` table.

---

### 4. **Dropping an Index**

The `DROP INDEX` command removes an index, which can improve insert and update performance but may slow down data retrieval.

**Syntax**:
```sql
DROP INDEX index_name;
```

**Example**:
```sql
DROP INDEX idx_last_name;
```

- This command deletes the index named `idx_last_name`.
- Dropping an index does not affect the data in the table but may impact query performance.

---

### 5. **Dropping a View**

The `DROP VIEW` command deletes a view, which is a virtual table based on a query.

**Syntax**:
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name [CASCADE | RESTRICT];
```

**Example**:
```sql
DROP VIEW high_salary_employees;
```

- This command deletes the view named `high_salary_employees`.
- If other views or functions depend on this view, you can use `CASCADE` to drop them as well.

---

### 6. **Dropping a Schema**

The `DROP SCHEMA` command removes a schema, which is a collection of tables, views, and other objects.

**Syntax**:
```sql
DROP SCHEMA schema_name [CASCADE | RESTRICT];
```

**Example**:
```sql
DROP SCHEMA hr CASCADE;
```

- This command deletes the `hr` schema and all objects within it, such as tables, views, and functions.
- Without `CASCADE`, `DROP SCHEMA` will fail if the schema contains any objects.

---

### 7. **Dropping a Sequence**

The `DROP SEQUENCE` command removes a sequence, often used for generating unique numeric values (e.g., for primary keys).

**Syntax**:
```sql
DROP SEQUENCE sequence_name;
```

**Example**:
```sql
DROP SEQUENCE order_id_seq;
```

- This command deletes the sequence named `order_id_seq`.
- Any tables or columns using this sequence will need to be adjusted or may lose automatic ID generation.

---

### 8. **Dropping a Function**

The `DROP FUNCTION` command removes a user-defined function from the database.

**Syntax**:
```sql
DROP FUNCTION function_name(parameter_types);
```

**Example**:
```sql
DROP FUNCTION calculate_tax(DECIMAL);
```

- This command deletes the `calculate_tax` function that takes a `DECIMAL` parameter.
- The parameter types must be specified to ensure the correct function is dropped if there are multiple functions with the same name.

---

### Using `CASCADE` and `RESTRICT` with `DROP`

- **CASCADE**: Automatically drops any dependent objects. Use this with caution, as it may remove more objects than expected.
- **RESTRICT**: Prevents the object from being dropped if it has any dependencies (default behavior).

---

### Examples of Using `DROP`

1. **Drop a Table and Its Dependencies**:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE orders CASCADE;
   ```
   - Deletes the `orders` table along with any foreign key dependencies or associated constraints.

2. **Drop a Database**:
   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE sales_data;
   ```
   - Permanently deletes the `sales_data` database and all objects within it.

3. **Drop a Column in a Table**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employees
   DROP COLUMN birth_date;
   ```
   - Removes the `birth_date` column from the `employees` table.

4. **Drop an Index**:
   ```sql
   DROP INDEX idx_customer_name;
   ```
   - Deletes the `idx_customer_name` index, which may affect query performance on the indexed column.

5. **Drop a Schema and Its Contents**:
   ```sql
   DROP SCHEMA hr CASCADE;
   ```
   - Removes the `hr` schema and all objects it contains, like tables and functions.

### When to Use `DROP`

- **Testing and Development**: When you want to remove temporary or outdated objects during development.
- **Clean Up**: To delete obsolete tables, views, or indexes that are no longer in use.
- **Recreate Structure**: When reinitializing tables or other objects with new structures or constraints.

### Summary

- The `DROP` command permanently deletes database objects, including tables, databases, indexes, schemas, and more.
- **Use with Caution**: Dropping an object cannot be undone and may affect other objects.
- **CASCADE**: Automatically removes dependencies.
- **RESTRICT**: Prevents the `DROP` if dependencies exist (default behavior).

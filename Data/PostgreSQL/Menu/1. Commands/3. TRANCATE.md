# TRANCATE

The **`TRUNCATE`** command in SQL is used to quickly delete all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions. In PostgreSQL, `TRUNCATE` is an efficient way to remove data from large tables, as it bypasses traditional `DELETE` operations and can be much faster. However, unlike `DELETE`, it does not trigger `ON DELETE` constraints or fire any `DELETE` triggers.

### Key Characteristics of `TRUNCATE`

1. **Faster than `DELETE`**: `TRUNCATE` removes all rows in a table in a single operation, which is usually faster than `DELETE` because it doesnâ€™t log individual row deletions.
2. **Resets Table Identity Columns**: By default, `TRUNCATE` resets any `SERIAL` or `IDENTITY` columns back to their starting value.
3. **Cannot be Rolled Back by Default**: While `TRUNCATE` can be part of a transaction in PostgreSQL, it's often non-reversible outside of a transactional block.
4. **No Row-Level Triggers**: `TRUNCATE` does not activate `DELETE` triggers since it doesn't delete rows one by one.

### Basic Syntax of `TRUNCATE`

```sql
TRUNCATE [TABLE] table_name;
```

- **TABLE**: The optional keyword `TABLE` is commonly used for readability but is not required.
- **table_name**: The name of the table you want to truncate.

### Basic Usage of `TRUNCATE`

To remove all rows from a table named `employees`, you would use:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
```

After this command, the `employees` table will be empty, with all rows deleted.

### Options with `TRUNCATE`

#### 1. **CASCADE**

If a table has foreign key constraints that reference other tables, using `TRUNCATE` on that table without the `CASCADE` option will result in an error. The `CASCADE` option removes rows from any dependent tables as well.

**Syntax**:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name CASCADE;
```

**Example**:
Suppose `orders` is referenced by another table called `order_items`. Truncating `orders` alone would raise an error due to the foreign key relationship. Using `CASCADE` will allow `TRUNCATE` to automatically remove rows from `order_items` as well.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE orders CASCADE;
```

#### 2. **RESTART IDENTITY**

The `RESTART IDENTITY` option resets any `SERIAL` or `IDENTITY` columns in the table back to their starting value, typically 1.

**Syntax**:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name RESTART IDENTITY;
```

**Example**:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees RESTART IDENTITY;
```

- This command truncates the `employees` table and resets any `SERIAL` or `IDENTITY` columns to their original starting values.

#### 3. **CONTINUE IDENTITY**

By default, `TRUNCATE` resets identity columns, but you can prevent this behavior by using `CONTINUE IDENTITY`, which keeps the current value of the identity column.

**Syntax**:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name CONTINUE IDENTITY;
```

**Example**:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees CONTINUE IDENTITY;
```

- This will truncate the `employees` table but retain the current sequence of `SERIAL` or `IDENTITY` columns without resetting them.

---

### Using `TRUNCATE` with Multiple Tables

You can truncate multiple tables in a single statement by listing them separated by commas.

**Example**:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees, departments;
```

This command removes all rows from both `employees` and `departments` tables.

---

### `TRUNCATE` in a Transaction Block

In PostgreSQL, `TRUNCATE` can be used within a transaction, allowing you to roll back the operation if needed.

**Example**:

```sql
BEGIN;
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
-- Other operations...
ROLLBACK; -- Undoes the TRUNCATE operation
```

In this case, if the `ROLLBACK` command is issued, the `TRUNCATE` operation is canceled, and all data in `employees` is retained.

### Key Differences Between `TRUNCATE` and `DELETE`

| Aspect                     | `TRUNCATE`                                       | `DELETE`                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Speed                      | Generally faster for large tables                | Slower for large tables                        |
| Logging                    | Minimal logging, no logging of individual rows   | Logs each row deletion                         |
| Triggers                   | Does not activate row-level triggers             | Activates `DELETE` triggers                    |
| Transactional Safety       | Must be used in a transaction block for rollback | Can be rolled back without a transaction block |
| Resetting Identity Columns | By default resets identity columns               | Does not reset identity columns                |
| Referential Integrity      | Requires `CASCADE` for dependent tables          | Can `DELETE` rows based on foreign key checks  |

### Examples of `TRUNCATE` in Practice

1. **Basic Truncation**: Empty the table while keeping identity values intact.

   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
   ```

2. **Truncate with Identity Reset**: Empty the table and reset identity columns to their initial values.

   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE employees RESTART IDENTITY;
   ```

3. **Truncate Multiple Tables with Cascade**: Empty multiple tables and their dependent tables.

   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE orders, customers CASCADE;
   ```

4. **Truncate in a Transaction**: Allow rollback of truncation within a transaction.
   ```sql
   BEGIN;
   TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
   -- Roll back to restore data
   ROLLBACK;
   ```

### Summary

- **`TRUNCATE`** is a fast and efficient way to delete all rows from a table.
- Use `CASCADE` to truncate related tables based on foreign key constraints.
- Use `RESTART IDENTITY` to reset serial or identity columns.
- Unlike `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE` does not activate row-level triggers, making it ideal for bulk data deletion.
- `TRUNCATE` can be used in a transaction, allowing for rollback if needed.

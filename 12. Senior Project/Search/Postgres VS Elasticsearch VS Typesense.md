| Feature / DB                   | **Postgres (FTS)**                                                             | **Elasticsearch**                                                            | **Typesense**                                                           |

| **Primary Purpose**            | Relational database with built-in full-text search                             | Distributed search & analytics engine                                        | Lightweight, developer-friendly search engine                           |
| **Search Type**                | Full-text search (tsvector, tsquery, GIN indexes)                              | Full-text, fuzzy, semantic (via plugins), aggregations                       | Full-text, typo tolerance, prefix search                                |
| **Data Model**                 | Relational (tables, rows)                                                      | Document-oriented (JSON)                                                     | Document-oriented (JSON)                                                |
| **Speed (Search Performance)** | Good for medium datasets; slower for very large scale                          | Very fast at scale; optimized for search & analytics                         | Very fast for small-to-medium datasets; optimized for low-latency       |
| **Scalability**                | Vertical scaling mostly                                                        | Horizontal scaling (clustered, distributed)                                  | Limited clustering (HA support in recent versions, but simpler than ES) |
| **Ease of Use**                | Steeper learning curve for search (complex queries)                            | Flexible but complex setup (requires cluster management)                     | Simple API, easy setup, developer-friendly                              |
| **Features**                   | Stemming, ranking (TS_RANK, BM25), custom dictionaries                         | Rich query DSL, fuzzy matching, aggregations, scoring, geospatial, analyzers | Built-in typo tolerance, synonyms, facets, filtering, geo search        |
| **Semantic Search Support**    | ❌ Not built-in (needs external embeddings + vector extension like pgvector)   | ✅ Native support for vectors (kNN, ANN search with dense_vector)            | ✅ Supports vectors (but simpler than ES, less flexible)                |
| **Use Cases**                  | Apps already using Postgres; smaller-to-medium datasets; simple keyword search | Large-scale search (e-commerce, logs, analytics, enterprise apps)            | SaaS apps, product search, instant search, small-to-medium datasets     |
| **Maintenance**                | Simple (already inside DB)                                                     | Complex (requires cluster ops, tuning, JVM)                                  | Simple, lightweight, minimal ops                                        |
| **Resource Usage**             | Low-medium (same as DB)                                                        | High (needs more RAM/CPU for indexing & queries)                             | Low-medium (optimized for speed & efficiency)                           |

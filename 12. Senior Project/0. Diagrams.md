# Types of Diagram

---

## 🧠 **UML Diagrams** (Unified Modeling Language – for software modeling)

### 1. **Structural Diagrams** – Describe the *static* structure of systems:

| Diagram Type                    | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class Diagram**               | Shows classes, their attributes, and relationships    |
| **Object Diagram**              | Shows instance-level relationships between objects    |
| **Component Diagram**           | Shows software components and dependencies            |
| **Package Diagram**             | Groups classes or components into packages            |
| **Deployment Diagram**          | Shows system hardware (nodes) and software deployment |
| **Composite Structure Diagram** | Internal structure of classes/parts                   |

### 2. **Behavioral Diagrams** – Describe *dynamic* behavior:

| Diagram Type                     | Purpose                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Case Diagram**             | High-level user interactions with the system    |
| **Activity Diagram**             | Workflow or business process (like a flowchart) |
| **Sequence Diagram**             | Time-ordered message exchanges between objects  |
| **State Machine Diagram**        | Object lifecycle & state transitions            |
| **Communication Diagram**        | Similar to sequence but shows interaction paths |
| **Interaction Overview Diagram** | Combines elements of activity + sequence        |
| **Timing Diagram**               | Precise time-based behavior (less common)       |

## 🧑‍💻 **UX & Product Flow Diagrams**

| Diagram Type             | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Flow Diagram**    | User navigation and decisions across screens/pages |
| **Customer Journey Map** | Maps customer experience and emotions              |
| **Wireflow**             | Wireframes + user flow                             |
| **Site Map**             | Structure of a website/app                         |
| **Task Flow**            | Specific task paths, often without decisions       |

## 🏗️ **System & Infrastructure Diagrams**

| Diagram Type                         | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **System Architecture Diagram**      | High-level tech architecture            |
| **Network Diagram**                  | Hardware, network devices, and topology |
| **ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship)** | Database schema and relationships       |
| **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**          | How data moves through a system         |
| **Sequence Diagram**                 | Message sequence in distributed systems |

## 🔄 **Other Useful Diagrams**

| Diagram Type     | Purpose                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flowchart**    | General-purpose logic and workflows                              |
| **BPMN Diagram** | Business Process Modeling Notation (standard business workflows) |
| **Mind Map**     | Brainstorming and ideation                                       |
| **Gantt Chart**  | Project timeline and scheduling                                  |

## 🔢 Summary

You can think of them in **categories**:

* 📦 Structure → *Class, Component, Deployment, ER*
* 🔁 Behavior → *Sequence, Activity, Use Case, State*
* 👤 User experience → *User Flow, Wireflow, Journey Map*
* 🌐 Infrastructure → *Architecture, Network, DFD*

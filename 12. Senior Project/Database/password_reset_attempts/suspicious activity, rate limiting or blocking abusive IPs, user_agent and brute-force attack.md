Great question! Let's break down **brute force** simply.

## 🛑 What is Brute Force?

**Brute force** is a type of **attack** where a hacker tries to **guess a password** (or token) by trying **many combinations** very quickly — until they succeed.

It’s like a thief trying every key on a keyring until one opens your door.

### 🔐 Common Types of Brute Force Attacks

| Type                    | What it does                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Login brute force**   | Tries thousands of password guesses for a username/email.        |
| **Token brute force**   | Tries random password reset tokens or email verification tokens. |
| **Credential stuffing** | Tries known leaked usernames and passwords from other sites.     |

### 💥 Why is Brute Force Dangerous?

- It can **crack weak passwords**.
- It can **bypass password reset** by guessing valid tokens.
- It can **drain system resources** or cause denial-of-service.

---

### 💻 Example

Let’s say a user’s email is: `user@example.com`

An attacker might try:

```
POST /login
email: user@example.com
password: password123

POST /login
email: user@example.com
password: password1234

POST /login
email: user@example.com
password: qwerty123

... thousands of times
```

If there’s **no rate limiting**, the attacker could eventually guess the correct password.

## ✅ How to Protect Against Brute Force

| Strategy            | How it helps                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Strong passwords | Harder to guess (long + symbols).                  |
| 🚫 Rate limiting    | Limits number of tries per minute.                 |
| ⏳ Delay or CAPTCHA | Slows down automated tools.                        |
| 🛑 Account lockout  | Temporarily blocks after too many failed attempts. |
| 🌍 IP blacklisting  | Blocks abusive IPs.                                |
| 🔐 2FA              | Even with password, attacker can’t log in.         |

## 🔁 In Your Case

You’re already preparing for brute force protection with:

- `password_reset_attempts` table
- `ip_address`, `user_agent` tracking
- `token_generated`, `success` flags
- Can easily implement rate limiting + alerts

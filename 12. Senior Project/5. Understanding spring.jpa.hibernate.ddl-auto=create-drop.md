# Understanding `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop`

This is a Hibernate property that controls the behavior of database schema generation in Spring Boot applications using JPA (Java Persistence API).

## What It Does

`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop` means:

1. **When the application starts**: Hibernate will **create** all database tables based on your entity classes
2. **While the application runs**: The schema remains unchanged
3. **When the application shuts down**: Hibernate will **drop** all created tables

## Common ddl-auto Options

| Value        | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `none`       | No action will be performed (default for most databases) |
| `validate`   | Validates the schema but makes no changes |
| `update`     | Updates the schema if needed (adds new tables/columns) |
| `create`     | Creates the schema on startup (but doesn't drop on shutdown) |
| `create-drop`| Creates on startup, drops on shutdown |

## When to Use create-drop

This setting is typically used for:
- **Development/testing environments** where you want a fresh database on each restart
- **Demo applications** where you need predictable initial state
- **Integration tests** that require clean database state

## Production Warning

ðŸš¨ **Never use `create-drop` in production!** It will:
- Delete all your data when the application restarts
- Cause potential data loss during maintenance or crashes
- Not maintain data integrity between deployments

For production, use:
```properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
```

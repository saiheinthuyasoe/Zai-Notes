These two fields are commonly used in a **password reset** feature in a web application. Here's what each of them is for:

---

### 1. `@Column(name = "password_reset_token")`

```java
private String passwordResetToken;
```

- **Purpose**: Stores a **unique token** (usually a random string or UUID) generated when a user requests to reset their password.
- This token is typically sent to the user's email as part of a password reset link (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/reset?token=abc123`).
- When the user clicks the link, the backend verifies this token to ensure it's valid and belongs to a user.

---

### 2. `@Column(name = "password_reset_expires")`

```java
private LocalDateTime passwordResetExpires;
```

- **Purpose**: Stores the **expiration date and time** for the token.
- Prevents the token from being reused after a certain period (e.g., expires after 15 minutes or 1 hour).
- Adds a layer of security to avoid misuse of old tokens.

---

### Example Usage Flow:

1. **User clicks "Forgot Password"**.
2. System:

   - Generates a token (e.g., UUID or secure random string).
   - Sets `passwordResetToken = "abc123xyz"`.
   - Sets `passwordResetExpires = now + 1 hour`.
   - Sends the reset link (`/reset?token=abc123xyz`) to the user's email.

3. **User clicks the reset link**.
4. System:

   - Looks up the user by `passwordResetToken`.
   - Checks if `passwordResetExpires` is still in the future.
   - Allows the user to set a new password if valid.

### Related Example in Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String email;
    private String password;

    @Column(name = "password_reset_token")
    private String passwordResetToken;

    @Column(name = "password_reset_expires")
    private LocalDateTime passwordResetExpires;

    // getters and setters
}
```

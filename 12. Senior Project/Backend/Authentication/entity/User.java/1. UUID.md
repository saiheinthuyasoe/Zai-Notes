A **UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)** is a 128-bit identifier used to uniquely label information in computer systems. It is designed to be unique across both space and time, meaning the probability of two UUIDs being the same is extremely low, even when generated independently.

### **Key Features of UUID:**

1. **128-bit (16 bytes)** – Typically represented as a 32-character hexadecimal string, separated by hyphens (e.g., `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`).
2. **Uniqueness** – Generated using a combination of timestamp, random numbers, and hardware identifiers (MAC address in some versions).
3. **Standardized** – Defined by **RFC 4122** and used in many software systems.

### **UUID Versions:**

| Version      | Description                        | Example Use Case              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **v1**       | Time-based + Node ID (MAC address) | Legacy systems                |
| **v2**       | DCE security UUID (rarely used)    | POSIX systems                 |
| **v3**       | MD5 hash of a namespace + name     | Generating UUIDs from names   |
| **v4**       | Randomly generated                 | Most common (APIs, databases) |
| **v5**       | SHA-1 hash of a namespace + name   | Similar to v3 but more secure |
| **v6/v7/v8** | Newer versions (time-ordered)      | Future applications           |

### **Example UUIDs:**

- **v4 (Random):** `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479`
- **v1 (Time-based):** `d5a3a7e0-8c1f-11eb-8dcd-0242ac130003`
- **v5 (SHA-1):** `1b671a64-40d5-491e-99b0-da01ff1f3341`

### **Common Uses:**

- Database primary keys (instead of auto-incrementing integers)
- Distributed systems (ensuring uniqueness without coordination)
- Session IDs, file names, API tokens

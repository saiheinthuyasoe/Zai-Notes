# Explanation of `@Component`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor`, and `@Slf4j`

## What are these annotations?

These are commonly used Java annotations in Spring Boot applications for different purposes.

### `@Component`
- **What**: Marks a class as a Spring component/bean
- **Why**: To make Spring manage this class as a bean in the application context
- **When**: When you want Spring to automatically detect and register the class
- **Where**: At the class level
- **How**: Spring scans and instantiates these classes during startup

Example:
```java
@Component
public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail() {
        // email sending logic
    }
}
```

### `@RequiredArgsConstructor`
- **What**: Generates a constructor with required arguments (final fields)
- **Why**: To automatically inject dependencies without writing constructors
- **When**: When your class has dependencies that need to be injected
- **Where**: At the class level
- **How**: Lombok generates the constructor at compile time

Example:
```java
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;
    private final InventoryService inventoryService;
    // Constructor is auto-generated
}
```

### `@Slf4j`
- **What**: Adds a logger (Logback/SLF4J) to your class
- **Why**: For easy logging without manual logger setup
- **When**: When you need logging in your class
- **Where**: At the class level
- **How**: Lombok generates a `log` field during compilation

Example:
```java
@Slf4j
public class UserService {
    public void createUser() {
        log.info("Creating new user");
        // user creation logic
    }
}
```

## Combined Example

Here's how they might be used together:

```java
@Component
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Slf4j
public class OrderProcessor {
    
    private final PaymentGateway paymentGateway;
    private final InventoryManager inventoryManager;
    
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        log.info("Processing order {}", order.getId());
        
        if (inventoryManager.checkStock(order)) {
            paymentGateway.charge(order);
            inventoryManager.updateStock(order);
            log.info("Order {} processed successfully", order.getId());
        } else {
            log.warn("Insufficient stock for order {}", order.getId());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
1. `@Component` makes this a Spring-managed bean
2. `@RequiredArgsConstructor` creates a constructor for the dependencies
3. `@Slf4j` provides the `log` field for logging
4. The class contains business logic with logging statements

# Practice Queries

### 1. **Practice Writing Complex Queries**

- **Goal**: Get comfortable using subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.
- **Activities**:
  - Write queries that use **subqueries** to filter results or calculate aggregate values.
  - Create **CTEs** for organizing long or complex queries into manageable chunks.
  - Practice using **window functions** like `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and `SUM()` over partitions.

**Exercise Example**:

```sql
-- Use a CTE to find the average salary by department and list employees earning above this average.
WITH DepartmentAvg AS (
  SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
)
SELECT e.name, e.salary, e.department
FROM employees e
JOIN DepartmentAvg da ON e.department = da.department
WHERE e.salary > da.avg_salary;
```

### 2. **Design a Small Relational Database**

- **Goal**: Apply database design principles and work with foreign key relationships.
- **Activities**:
  - Choose a small project, such as a library management system, a simple e-commerce database, or a social media app.
  - Define tables, fields, and relationships, and use constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, etc.
  - Practice normalizing your tables to at least **3NF (Third Normal Form)**.

**Exercise Example**:

```sql
-- Example schema for a simple e-commerce database
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
  order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders(id),
  product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id),
  quantity INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

### 3. **Work on Query Optimization**

- **Goal**: Learn to write efficient queries and optimize database performance.
- **Activities**:
  - Use the `EXPLAIN` keyword to analyze your queries and identify performance bottlenecks.
  - Practice creating **indexes** and observe the impact on query performance.
  - Experiment with indexing strategies (e.g., single-column vs. multi-column indexes).

**Exercise Example**:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100;
```

- **Try Adding an Index**:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_price ON products(price);
  ```

### 4. **Work with JSON Data**

- **Goal**: Get hands-on experience using PostgreSQL’s support for JSON and JSONB data types.
- **Activities**:
  - Create tables that store JSON data and practice querying and updating the JSON content.
  - Use functions like `->`, `->>`, `@>`, and `jsonb_set()` to manipulate JSON data.

**Exercise Example**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  profile_data JSONB
);

-- Insert JSON data
INSERT INTO user_profiles (profile_data)
VALUES ('{"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "skills": ["PostgreSQL", "Python"]}');

-- Query JSON data
SELECT profile_data->>'name' AS name FROM user_profiles;
```

---

### 5. **Implement Functions and Triggers**

- **Goal**: Automate tasks using PostgreSQL functions and triggers.
- **Activities**:
  - Write a function to perform a calculation or automate a process.
  - Create a trigger that executes your function when a specific event occurs.

**Exercise Example**:

```sql
-- Create a function to log data changes
CREATE FUNCTION log_changes() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, operation, old_data, new_data, change_time)
  VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, OLD::text, NEW::text, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create a trigger to use this function
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_changes();
```

---

### 6. **Experiment with Transactions**

- **Goal**: Understand how to use transactions to maintain data integrity.
- **Activities**:
  - Practice using `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` to group queries and handle errors.
  - Write scripts that simulate real-world scenarios, such as transferring money between accounts.

**Exercise Example**:

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
-- If an error occurs, use ROLLBACK instead of COMMIT
```

### 7. **Build a Mini-Project**

- **Goal**: Apply everything you’ve learned by building a full-fledged PostgreSQL-based project.
- **Project Ideas**:
  - **Simple Blogging Platform**: Users can create accounts, write posts, and comment.
  - **Bookstore Database**: Manage books, authors, customers, and orders.
  - **Task Management App**: Users can create tasks, assign them to categories, and set due dates.

**Steps**:

1. Design the database schema.
2. Write scripts to create tables and insert sample data.
3. Practice writing queries to fetch, update, and delete data.
4. Optimize queries and use functions, triggers, and transactions.

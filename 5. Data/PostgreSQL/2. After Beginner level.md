# Next steps after beginner level

## 1. **Advanced Query Techniques**

### 1.1. **Subqueries**
- A subquery is a query nested inside another query. You can use subqueries in `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and other clauses.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

### 1.2. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- CTEs allow you to define temporary result sets that can be referred to within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.

**Syntax**:
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

**Example**:
```sql
WITH SalesCTE AS (
  SELECT department, SUM(amount) AS total_sales 
  FROM sales 
  GROUP BY department
)
SELECT * FROM SalesCTE WHERE total_sales > 10000;
```

### 1.3. **Window Functions**
- Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. Useful for running totals, ranking, etc.

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT name, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```

## 2. **Database Design and Normalization**

### 2.1. **Normalization**
- Organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The main forms are:
  - **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Ensures that the values in a table are atomic and each column has unique values.
  - **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Removes partial dependencies by ensuring that non-key columns are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
  - **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Removes transitive dependencies to ensure that non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key attributes.

## 3. **Indexing**

### 3.1. **Creating Indexes**
- Indexes speed up data retrieval at the cost of additional storage and slower `INSERT`/`UPDATE` operations.

**Syntax**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
```

### 3.2. **Types of Indexes**
- **B-Tree Index**: The default index type, used for most queries.
- **Hash Index**: Suitable for equality comparisons.
- **GIN and GiST Indexes**: Used for more complex data types like arrays and full-text search.

## 4. **Transactions**

### 4.1. **ACID Properties**
- **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing.
- **Consistency**: Transactions must leave the database in a consistent state.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the case of a system failure.

### 4.2. **Using Transactions**
```sql
BEGIN;
-- Your SQL queries here
COMMIT;
-- Or ROLLBACK if an error occurs
```

**Example**:
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

## 5. **Views**

### 5.1. **Creating Views**
- Views are virtual tables created from a query. They simplify complex queries and enhance security.

**Syntax**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS 
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW ActiveEmployees AS 
SELECT name, department FROM employees WHERE status = 'active';
```

### 5.2. **Using Views**
```sql
SELECT * FROM ActiveEmployees;
```

---

## 6. **Triggers and Functions**

### 6.1. **Functions**
- Functions allow you to encapsulate SQL logic for reuse.

**Syntax**:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION function_name(parameters)
RETURNS return_type AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Function logic
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 6.2. **Triggers**
- Triggers automatically execute a function in response to certain events on a table (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

**Syntax**:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
AFTER INSERT ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION function_name();
```

---

## 7. **Optimization Techniques**

### 7.1. **Query Optimization**
- Analyze your queries using `EXPLAIN` to see how PostgreSQL executes them and make adjustments.

**Example**:
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';
```

### 7.2. **Performance Tips**
- Use indexes wisely but avoid excessive indexing.
- Avoid using `SELECT *`; specify only the columns you need.
- Use proper data types and avoid overusing large data types.

---

## 8. **Working with JSON Data**

### 8.1. **Storing and Querying JSON**
- PostgreSQL supports storing JSON and querying it using JSON functions.

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_details JSONB
);

INSERT INTO orders (order_details) 
VALUES ('{"customer": "John Doe", "items": ["apple", "banana"]}');
```

### 8.2. **Querying JSON Data**
```sql
SELECT order_details->>'customer' FROM orders WHERE order_details @> '{"items": ["apple"]}';
```

---

## 9. **Foreign Key Relationships**

### 9.1. **Creating Foreign Keys**
- Establish relationships between tables to maintain data integrity.

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  department_id INTEGER REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```

### Next Steps
1. Practice writing more complex queries using subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.
2. Design a small database with relationships and experiment with normalization.
3. Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze and optimize your queries.
4. Experiment with creating views, functions, and triggers to automate tasks.

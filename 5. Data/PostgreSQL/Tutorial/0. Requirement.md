### **1. Basics of PostgreSQL**

- **Installation and Configuration**: Understand how to install PostgreSQL and configure it for different environments.
- **Database Creation**: Learn to create and manage databases.
- **Basic Commands**: Practice essential SQL commands:
  - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
  - `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`
- **Connection Management**: Know how to connect to PostgreSQL using tools like `psql`, PgAdmin, or application frameworks.

---

### **2. Data Types**

- Familiarize yourself with PostgreSQL's rich data types:
  - Basic: `INTEGER`, `TEXT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, `BOOLEAN`
  - Advanced: `JSON/JSONB`, `ARRAY`, `HSTORE`, `UUID`
- Understand how to choose the right data types for specific use cases.

---

### **3. Indexing**

- Learn about different types of indexes and when to use them:
  - B-Tree (default)
  - Hash
  - GIN (for full-text search, JSONB)
  - GiST (geospatial queries)
- Study **index creation** (`CREATE INDEX`) and their impact on performance.

---

### **4. Query Optimization**

- Analyze query execution with `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
- Use `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` for database maintenance.
- Learn how to optimize slow queries:
  - Proper indexing
  - Writing efficient SQL queries
  - Using CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and window functions effectively

---

### **5. Advanced SQL Features**

- Use advanced PostgreSQL functionalities:
  - **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LEAD`, `LAG`
  - **CTEs**: `WITH` queries for readability and performance
  - **Full-Text Search**: Using `tsvector`, `tsquery`, and `to_tsvector`
  - **Joins and Subqueries**: Master complex joins and nested queries

---

### **6. Transactions and Concurrency**

- Understand ACID properties.
- Practice working with:
  - `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`
  - Savepoints
- Learn about locking mechanisms and isolation levels.

---

### **7. PostgreSQL Extensions**

- Explore useful extensions like:
  - `PostGIS` for geospatial data
  - `pg_stat_statements` for query performance
  - `pg_cron` for scheduled tasks
  - `unaccent` for text normalization

---

### **8. Backup and Recovery**

- Learn how to back up and restore databases:
  - Logical backups: `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`
  - Physical backups: `pg_basebackup`
- Understand Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) and WAL (Write-Ahead Logging).

---

### **9. Security**

- User and role management: `CREATE ROLE`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`
- Understand authentication methods: `md5`, `scram-sha-256`, etc.
- Work with SSL to secure connections.
- Use Row-Level Security (RLS) for fine-grained access control.

---

### **10. Working with ORMs**

- Learn to use PostgreSQL with popular ORMs like Hibernate (Java), Sequelize (Node.js), or Django ORM (Python).
- Understand how to write and optimize queries generated by ORMs.

---

### **11. High Availability and Scalability**

- Understand replication:
  - Streaming replication
  - Logical replication
- Explore sharding and partitioning for large datasets.
- Learn about connection pooling tools like `PgBouncer` or `Pgpool-II`.

---

### **12. Monitoring and Performance Tuning**

- Use built-in tools like:
  - `pg_stat_activity`
  - `pg_stat_database`
  - `pg_stat_replication`
- Work with external tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring.

---

### **13. Practice**

- Build real-world projects to consolidate your knowledge.
- Solve challenges on platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, or SQLZoo.
- Read the official [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

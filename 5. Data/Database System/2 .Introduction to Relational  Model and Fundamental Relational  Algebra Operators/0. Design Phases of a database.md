# Design Phases of a database

**design phases of a database** with a **simple example**.

### Example: **Online Store Database**
We will design a database for an **online store** that sells products. The database needs to store information about **customers**, **products**, and **orders**.

---

### 1. **Application Requirements**:
   - **What is needed**: Understand the purpose of the database.
   - **For our example**: We need to store information about customers, products, and orders. 
   - **For example**: The application needs to track which customers are buying which products, how many products theyâ€™ve ordered, and when the orders were made.

---

### 2. **Conceptual Database Design**:
   - **What happens**: We design a **high-level model** of the data, focusing on what data we need, not how it will be stored.
   - **For our example**: We define the key entities and their relationships:
     - **Customers** (who are buying products)
     - **Products** (what is being sold)
     - **Orders** (what the customers are purchasing)
   - **We draw a diagram** (an Entity-Relationship diagram) showing the entities and how they are related.

     ```
     Customers <--> Orders <--> Products
     ```

---

### 3. **Relational DBMS**:
   - **What happens**: We decide on the **Database Management System (DBMS)** that will be used to store the data.
   - **For our example**: We choose a **relational DBMS** like **MySQL** to store and manage the database.
   - The **DBMS** is the software that will handle all the data storage, retrieval, and manipulation tasks.

---

### 4. **Logical Database Design**:
   - **What happens**: We translate the **conceptual design** (entities and relationships) into a **detailed logical structure**, typically using a **relational model**.
   - **For our example**: We turn the entities into **tables**:
     - **Customers Table** (stores customer details)
     - **Products Table** (stores product details)
     - **Orders Table** (stores details about orders placed)
   - We also define the relationships, like **foreign keys**:
     - The **Orders Table** will link to the **Customers Table** using **Customer ID**.
     - The **Orders Table** will also link to the **Products Table** using **Product ID**.

---

### 5. **Entity-Relationship (ER) Data Model**:
   - **What happens**: We create an **ER diagram** to visualize the entities and relationships clearly.
   - **For our example**: The **ER diagram** looks like this:
     - **Customer** (Customer ID, Name, Address)
     - **Product** (Product ID, Name, Price)
     - **Order** (Order ID, Customer ID, Product ID, Quantity)

     This ER diagram shows how the tables are linked together.

---

### 6. **Physical Database Design**:
   - **What happens**: We think about how the data will be **physically stored** and how the database will perform efficiently.
   - **For our example**: We decide:
     - **Indexes** will be created on fields like **Product ID** and **Customer ID** for faster lookups.
     - Data will be stored in **files** that the DBMS will manage efficiently.

---

### 7. **Relational Model**:
   - **What happens**: We organize the data into **tables** (relations) with **columns** (attributes) and **rows** (records).
   - **For our example**: The tables might look like this:
   
   **Customers Table**:
   | Customer ID | Name       | Address        |
   |-------------|------------|----------------|
   | 1           | John Smith | 123 Elm St.    |
   | 2           | Jane Doe   | 456 Oak St.    |

   **Products Table**:
   | Product ID | Name      | Price |
   |------------|-----------|-------|
   | 1          | T-Shirt   | 15    |
   | 2          | Jeans     | 40    |

   **Orders Table**:
   | Order ID | Customer ID | Product ID | Quantity |
   |----------|-------------|------------|----------|
   | 1        | 1           | 1          | 2        |
   | 2        | 2           | 2          | 1        |

---

### 8. **Database Implementation**:
   - **What happens**: The database is created in the chosen DBMS (e.g., MySQL), using SQL commands to create the tables and relationships.
   - **For our example**: We use SQL to create the tables:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Customers (
       CustomerID INT,
       Name VARCHAR(255),
       Address VARCHAR(255)
     );

     CREATE TABLE Products (
       ProductID INT,
       Name VARCHAR(255),
       Price DECIMAL
     );

     CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT,
       CustomerID INT,
       ProductID INT,
       Quantity INT
     );
     ```

---

### 9. **File Organization and Access Path**:
   - **What happens**: We decide how the data is stored in files on the disk, and how to **access** it quickly.
   - **For our example**: We set up **indexes** on **CustomerID** and **ProductID** for faster searching, ensuring the system can quickly find the data when needed.

---

### In Summary:
1. **Application Requirements**: Understand the needs (what data is required).
2. **Conceptual Design**: High-level design of the entities and their relationships (ER diagram).
3. **Relational DBMS**: Choose the DBMS for managing the data (e.g., MySQL).
4. **Logical Database Design**: Convert the conceptual design into a relational model (tables and relationships).
5. **ER Model**: Create an ER diagram for visualizing data and relationships.
6. **Physical Design**: Decide on how to store and access data efficiently (indexes, storage).
7. **Relational Model**: Organize data into tables.
8. **Implementation**: Create the database with SQL.
9. **File Organization & Access Path**: Optimize how the data is stored and accessed.

This is the process of designing a database from **understanding the requirements** to **implementing it**.

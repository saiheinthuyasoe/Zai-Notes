### Domain of Attribute

**Attribute Names**:

- **Domain**: A set of permitted values for an attribute.
  - **Example**: The domain of `branch_name` is the set of all branch names.

#### Types of Domains:

1. **Logical Level Domain**:

   - A set of all possible values for an attribute.
   - **Example**: The domain of `branch_name` is a set of valid branch names like "Downtown", "Uptown", "Main Street", etc.

2. **Physical Level Domain**:
   - Defines how the attribute is physically stored in the database.
   - **Example**: The domain for `branch_name` could be `char(30)`, meaning it is a character string that can hold up to 30 characters.

#### Simple Example:

Letâ€™s say we have a table called **Branch**:

| BranchID | BranchName  | Location |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1        | Downtown    | City A   |
| 2        | Uptown      | City B   |
| 3        | Main Street | City C   |

- **Logical Level Domain**: The domain for the `BranchName` attribute is the set of all valid branch names (e.g., "Downtown", "Uptown", "Main Street").
- **Physical Level Domain**: The physical storage of `BranchName` could be `char(30)`, meaning it is stored as a 30-character string, with empty spaces padded if the name is shorter than 30 characters.

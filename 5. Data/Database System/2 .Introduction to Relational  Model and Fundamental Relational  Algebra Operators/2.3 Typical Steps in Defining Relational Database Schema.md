# Typical Steps in Defining Relational Database Schema

### 1. Define the relations, with a unique name for each relation

In a relational database, a **relation** is essentially a table, and it should have a unique name to identify it.

#### **Example**:

- `Customers`
- `Orders`

---

### 2. Define attributes for each relation and specify the domain for each attribute

Each **relation** (table) will have **attributes** (columns), and each attribute will have a **domain**, which defines what kind of data can be stored in that column (e.g., text, integer, date).

#### **Example**:

- **Customers Relation**:

  - `customer_id` (integer) - unique ID for each customer
  - `customer_name` (string) - name of the customer
  - `customer_email` (string) - email address of the customer

- **Orders Relation**:
  - `order_id` (integer) - unique ID for each order
  - `order_date` (date) - date when the order was placed
  - `customer_id` (integer) - ID of the customer who placed the order (Foreign Key)

---

### 3. Specify the key(s) for each relation

A **key** is used to uniquely identify records in a table. The two main types of keys are:

- **Candidate Keys**: One or more columns that can uniquely identify a record. Any one of these could be chosen as the **Primary Key**.
- **Primary Key**: A candidate key that is selected as the unique identifier for the table.

#### **Example**:

- **Customers Table**:

  - **Candidate Key**: `customer_id` (unique ID for each customer)
  - **Primary Key**: `customer_id` (since it uniquely identifies each customer)

- **Orders Table**:
  - **Candidate Key**: `order_id` (unique ID for each order)
  - **Primary Key**: `order_id` (since it uniquely identifies each order)

---

### 4. Specify all appropriate foreign keys and integrity constraints

**Foreign Keys** ensure referential integrity between tables. A **foreign key** in one table points to the **primary key** of another table, establishing a relationship.

**Integrity Constraints** ensure the data is valid and consistent across the database.

#### **Example**:

- In the **Orders Table**, `customer_id` is a **foreign key** that references `customer_id` in the **Customers Table**.

  - **Foreign Key**: `customer_id` in the **Orders** table points to the `customer_id` in the **Customers** table.

  - **Integrity Constraints**: Ensures that a valid `customer_id` exists in the **Customers** table before inserting it into the **Orders** table.

---

## Complete Example in SQL:

```sql
-- Creating Customers Table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    customer_email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

-- Creating Orders Table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
```

---

### **Summary of the Steps**:

1. **Define Relations**: Give each table a unique name (e.g., `Customers`, `Orders`).
2. **Define Attributes and Domains**: Specify the columns and their data types (e.g., `customer_id` INT, `customer_name` VARCHAR).
3. **Specify Keys**: Identify the candidate key and select the primary key (e.g., `customer_id` for `Customers`, `order_id` for `Orders`).
4. **Foreign Keys & Integrity Constraints**: Define relationships between tables using foreign keys and apply integrity constraints to ensure valid data.

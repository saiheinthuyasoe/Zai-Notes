# **Basic Constraints in a Database**

In databases, **constraints** are rules that help maintain the integrity and accuracy of the data. There are different types of constraints, and they help ensure that the data entered into a database is valid, consistent, and reliable.

Here are three basic types of constraints:

---

### **1. Domain Constraints**

- **Definition**: These constraints define the **type** and **range of valid values** for a column (attribute). They ensure that the data entered in a column matches the **expected type** (e.g., integer, text) and stays within an acceptable range or set of values.

#### **Example**:

- Let's say you have a `customer_age` column in a `Customers` table. A domain constraint for this column could be:

  - **Data Type**: `INTEGER` (only whole numbers).
  - **Range**: Between 1 and 199 (since age can't be negative or over 199).

  SQL representation of a domain constraint:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT,
    customer_age INT CHECK (customer_age >= 1 AND customer_age <= 199)
  );
  ```

  - In this case, the **domain constraint** ensures that `customer_age` is an integer between 1 and 199.

### **2. Key Constraints**

- **Definition**: Key constraints ensure that the **values in certain columns are unique** or that a **column can uniquely identify a row** in a table. The most common key constraints are **Primary Key** and **Unique Key**.

#### **Primary Key**:

- A **Primary Key** constraint ensures that each row in a table is uniquely identified by one or more columns. It also ensures that the primary key column cannot have `NULL` values.

#### **Example**:

- For a table of `Customers`, you could have a `customer_id` column as the primary key:

  - **Primary Key**: `customer_id` must be unique for each customer.

  SQL representation of a primary key constraint:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

  - This ensures that each `customer_id` is unique and cannot be `NULL`.

#### **Unique Key**:

- A **Unique Key** constraint ensures that all values in a column (or a set of columns) are unique across the table, but unlike the **Primary Key**, it can allow `NULL` values.

#### **Example**:

- You could add a **Unique Key** constraint on the `email` column to ensure no two customers have the same email address:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
  );
  ```

---

### **3. Referential Integrity Constraints (Foreign Key Constraints)**

- **Definition**: These constraints ensure that relationships between tables are consistent. A **Foreign Key** constraint ensures that a value in one table (the foreign key) must match a value in another table (the primary key or unique key in the other table). This maintains **referential integrity** between tables.

#### **Example**:

- Imagine two tables: `Customers` and `Orders`. In the `Orders` table, we want to ensure that every order belongs to a valid customer from the `Customers` table.

- To do this, we can use a **Foreign Key** constraint:
  - The `customer_id` in the `Orders` table must match a `customer_id` from the `Customers` table.

SQL representation of a foreign key constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
```

- In this case, the **Foreign Key constraint** ensures that every `customer_id` in the `Orders` table corresponds to an existing `customer_id` in the `Customers` table. If you try to insert an order with a `customer_id` that doesn't exist in the `Customers` table, the database will reject the operation.

### **Summary of Constraints**

| **Constraint Type**                     | **Description**                                                                                | **Example**                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain Constraint**                   | Ensures the data in a column follows a specific type or range.                                 | `customer_age` must be between 1 and 199 (using a `CHECK` constraint).                       |
| **Key Constraint (Primary Key/Unique)** | Ensures uniqueness of a column or a set of columns.                                            | `customer_id` must be unique for each customer (using a `PRIMARY KEY`).                      |
| **Referential Integrity (Foreign Key)** | Ensures that a value in one table matches a value in another table, maintaining relationships. | `customer_id` in `Orders` must match a `customer_id` in `Customers` (using a `FOREIGN KEY`). |

### **In Simple Terms**:

1. **Domain Constraints**: Make sure the data is of the correct type and within acceptable limits (like age being a valid number).
2. **Key Constraints**: Ensure each row can be uniquely identified (e.g., every customer has a unique `customer_id`).
3. **Referential Integrity**: Makes sure that relationships between tables are valid (e.g., each order belongs to a valid customer).

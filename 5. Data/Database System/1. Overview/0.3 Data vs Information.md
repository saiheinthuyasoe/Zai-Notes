# Data vs Information

Hereâ€™s a simple way to understand the difference between **data** and **information**:

- **Data**: Raw facts and figures. They are not organized or meaningful on their own.  
  Example: "25, 70, sunny"  

- **Information**: Processed and organized data that makes sense and is useful.  
  Example: "The temperature is 25Â°C, with 70% humidity, and it's sunny."

In short, **data** is like the ingredients, and **information** is the meal made from those ingredients! ðŸ˜Š

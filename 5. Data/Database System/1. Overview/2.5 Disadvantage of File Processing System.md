Here are the **disadvantages of a File Processing System**:

---

### 1. **Data Redundancy and Inconsistency**:

- **Redundancy**: The same data is stored in multiple files, leading to unnecessary duplication.
- **Inconsistency**: If one copy of the data is updated while others are not, it results in mismatched or outdated information.

### 2. **Difficulty in Data Access**:

- Retrieving specific or related data requires custom programs for each task, making access time-consuming and less efficient.

### 3. **Lack of Security**:

- File systems typically lack robust mechanisms to secure data, leading to unauthorized access or loss of sensitive information.

### 4. **No Centralized Control**:

- There's no centralized system to manage all the files, making it difficult to enforce rules like who can access or modify data.

### 5. **Limited Scalability**:

- File systems struggle to handle large amounts of data or complex queries efficiently as the volume of data grows.

### 6. **No Multi-User Access**:

- File systems are not designed for simultaneous access by multiple users. This can cause data corruption or overwrite issues when multiple users try to access the same file.

### 7. **Data Dependency**:

- The structure and storage of data are tightly linked to the application. If the file format changes, the associated programs may also need to be rewritten.

### 8. **Difficult Backup and Recovery**:

- Creating backups or recovering from system crashes is challenging, as there is no built-in mechanism for managing this.

### 9. **Limited Query Capabilities**:

- Performing complex searches or queries across multiple files is cumbersome and requires custom coding or manual effort.

### Example:

In a school management system:

- **Issue**: Student data is stored in one file, grades in another, and attendance in a third file. To create a report card, you must manually link all the files, leading to potential errors and delays.

**Why Databases Are Better**: Modern databases address these disadvantages by centralizing data, reducing redundancy, enhancing security, and enabling efficient querying and multi-user access.

# Data vs Meta Data

### **Data**:

- **Raw facts** or **details** that by themselves don’t mean much.
- It could be numbers, text, measurements, etc.
- Example:
  - "John Doe"
  - "2024-11-20"
  - "25°C"
  - "100"

### **Metadata**:

- **Data about data**. It describes or gives **context** to the raw data.
- It tells you **where** the data comes from, **how** it's structured, or **what** the data represents.
- Example:
  - **For "John Doe"**: The metadata could be:
    - **What it is**: "Name"
    - **Who it belongs to**: "Employee record"
    - **Length**: "5 characters"
  - **For "25°C"**: The metadata could be:
    - **What it is**: "Temperature"
    - **Unit**: "Celsius"
    - **Location**: "Paris"
    - **Time**: "12:00 PM"

### Example 1: **Employee Record**

- **Data**:
  - Name: "John Doe"
  - Age: 30
  - Department: "HR"
- **Metadata**:
  - Column Names: "Name," "Age," "Department" (describes what each piece of data is)
  - Data Types: "Name" is text, "Age" is a number, "Department" is text
  - Source: "Employee Database"
  - Created On: "January 1, 2020"
  - Last Modified: "November 20, 2024"

The **data** is the actual information (name, age, department). The **metadata** is the information about the **data** itself (column names, types, source, etc.).

### Example 2: **Photo on Your Phone**

- **Data**:
  - The actual **photo** you took (the picture itself)
- **Metadata**:
  - **Date taken**: "2024-11-20"
  - **Camera settings**: "ISO 400, F/2.8"
  - **File size**: "2MB"
  - **Location**: "Paris"

The **data** is the actual image (photo). The **metadata** is the extra information about the photo, like when and where it was taken, the camera settings, etc.

---

### Summary:

- **Data** is the actual content (e.g., numbers, names, pictures).
- **Metadata** is extra information that describes the **data** (e.g., the type, source, date, or format).

**Think of metadata as a label or instructions that tell you about the data**. It adds context, helping you understand and use the raw data correctly.

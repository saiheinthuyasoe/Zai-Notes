# Testing with Postman

Great! Now that we have set up the backend, let's move on to the **next steps**: testing the APIs and ensuring everything works smoothly.

### **Test the APIs Using Postman**

Now that your backend is set up and running, it's time to test your APIs to ensure they work as expected.

#### **Testing APIs with Postman**:

1. **GET all properties**:
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/properties`
   - Test this by making a GET request in Postman, and ensure it returns a list of properties (it might be empty initially).
   
2. **POST new property**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/properties`
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "title": "Beautiful Beach House",
       "description": "A lovely beach house with sea view.",
       "location": "Malibu, CA",
       "price": 1200000,
       "images": ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"]
     }
     ```
   - If the property is added successfully, you should get a `201 Created` response with the newly added property.

3. **GET property by ID**:
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/properties/:id`
   - After adding a property, use its ID to fetch the property details by making a GET request.

4. **PUT update property**:
   - Endpoint: `PUT /api/properties/:id`
   - Update a property with new values, for example, the price:
     ```json
     {
       "price": 1250000
     }
     ```

5. **DELETE a property**:
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/properties/:id`
   - Delete a property using its ID.

Make sure that your authentication (if implemented already) works as expected. For example, ensure only admins can POST, PUT, or DELETE properties.

# What is JWT?

**JWT**, or **JSON Web Token**, is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

### Structure of JWT

A JWT is made up of three parts, separated by dots (`.`):

1. **Header**:
   - Contains metadata about the token, including the type of token and the signing algorithm used (e.g., HMAC SHA256 or RSA).
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "HS256",
       "typ": "JWT"
     }
     ```

2. **Payload**:
   - Contains the claims or the information you want to transmit. Claims can include user information (like user ID) or other data.
   - There are three types of claims:
     - **Registered claims**: Predefined claims such as `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), and `sub` (subject).
     - **Public claims**: Custom claims defined by the user.
     - **Private claims**: Claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "sub": "1234567890",
       "name": "John Doe",
       "admin": true
     }
     ```

3. **Signature**:
   - The signature is created by taking the encoded header, encoded payload, a secret (or a private key for RSA), and signing it using the specified algorithm.
   - Example for HMAC SHA256:
     ```plaintext
     HMACSHA256(
       base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
       base64UrlEncode(payload),
       secret)
     ```

### Complete JWT Example

A complete JWT looks like this:
```

```

### How JWT Works

1. **User Authentication**:
   - A user logs in with their credentials (e.g., username and password).
   - The server validates the credentials and, if valid, generates a JWT.

2. **Token Generation**:
   - The server creates a JWT using the user information (claims) and signs it with a secret key.

3. **Token Transmission**:
   - The server sends the JWT back to the client (usually in the response body or as a cookie).

4. **Client Storage**:
   - The client stores the JWT (e.g., in local storage or cookies) for future requests.

5. **Authorization**:
   - For subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT in the HTTP headers (commonly in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token).
     ```http
     Authorization: Bearer <token>
     ```

6. **Token Verification**:
   - The server receives the request with the JWT and verifies it using the secret key or public key.
   - If the token is valid and not expired, the server processes the request; otherwise, it rejects the request.

### Why is JWT Necessary?

1. **Stateless Authentication**:
   - JWTs are self-contained and can hold all the information required for user authentication. This allows for stateless sessions, meaning the server does not need to store session data. Each request contains the JWT, making it easier to scale applications.

2. **Security**:
   - JWTs are signed, which allows the receiver to verify that the sender is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.
   - When properly implemented (e.g., using HTTPS, strong signing algorithms), JWTs can provide a secure way to handle authentication.

3. **Cross-Domain Single Sign-On (SSO)**:
   - JWT can be used for single sign-on across different domains, enabling users to authenticate once and access multiple applications without logging in again.

4. **Decentralized**:
   - JWT can be verified without requiring access to the server, which allows for decentralized authentication (e.g., microservices).

5. **Expiration and Revocation**:
   - JWTs can have expiration times set, making it easier to manage sessions. Although revocation is more challenging (since they are stateless), strategies can be implemented (like maintaining a revocation list).

### Summary

- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a compact, secure way to transmit information as a JSON object, primarily used for authentication and information exchange.
- It works by allowing clients to obtain a token after successful login, which can be used for subsequent requests to prove their identity without needing to re-authenticate.
- Its stateless nature, security, and support for SSO make JWT a popular choice for modern web applications.

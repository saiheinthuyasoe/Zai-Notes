# What is Bcrypt?

**Bcrypt** is a password-hashing function designed to securely store passwords by transforming them into cryptographic hashes that are hard to reverse-engineer. It's widely used in web development and authentication systems to ensure that users' passwords are stored in a secure and tamper-resistant format.

### Key Concepts of Bcrypt:

1. **Hashing**:

   - Bcrypt transforms passwords into fixed-length strings (hashes). Even a small change in the input password will produce a completely different hash.
   - Example:
     - Password: `"mypassword123"`
     - Bcrypt Hash: `$2b$10$6fyqfDfh/W/aX.Q.hXOVuupubNoquEs7O/l.ygV2opFXqMzRMZI06`

2. **Salting**:

   - Bcrypt adds a **salt** (a random value) to the password before hashing it, making it unique. This prevents attackers from using precomputed hash tables (known as **rainbow tables**) to crack passwords.
   - Even if two users have the same password, Bcrypt will generate different hashes because of the unique salt.

3. **Work Factor (Cost Factor)**:

   - Bcrypt has a configurable "cost" factor, determining how slow the hashing process should be. The higher the cost factor, the more computation is required to generate a hash, which helps protect against brute-force attacks.
   - The cost is often represented as a number, such as `10`. A higher number makes hashing slower, adding security by making it harder for attackers to crack the password.

4. **One-Way Function**:
   - Bcrypt is a one-way cryptographic function, meaning once a password is hashed, it cannot be reversed. The only way to "check" a password is to hash a new input and compare it with the stored hash.

### Why is Bcrypt Necessary?

- **Password Security**: Storing plain-text passwords in a database is dangerous, as attackers can easily access them if they compromise the system. Bcrypt ensures that even if the password database is leaked, the passwords themselves are difficult to crack.
- **Defense Against Attacks**:
  - **Rainbow Table Attacks**: Precomputed tables of password hashes can be used to crack weakly hashed passwords. Bcrypt defeats this by salting every password hash, ensuring that even identical passwords result in different hashes.
  - **Brute Force Attacks**: Bcrypt's work factor makes it computationally expensive to hash passwords, slowing down brute-force attempts.

### Example of Bcrypt in Node.js

Hereâ€™s how Bcrypt is used in a Node.js project to hash a password before storing it:

```typescript
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";

// Hash a password before saving it to the database
const hashPassword = async (password: string) => {
  const saltRounds = 10; // Work factor (cost factor)
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
  return hashedPassword;
};

// Compare a user-entered password with the stored hashed password
const comparePassword = async (enteredPassword: string, storedHash: string) => {
  const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(enteredPassword, storedHash);
  return isMatch;
};

// Usage example:
const password = "mypassword123";
const hashedPassword = await hashPassword(password);
console.log("Hashed Password:", hashedPassword);

// Verifying password during login
const isValid = await comparePassword("mypassword123", hashedPassword);
console.log("Is valid password:", isValid);
```

### Common Operations in Bcrypt:

1. **Generating a Hash**:

   ```javascript
   const saltRounds = 10;
   const hash = await bcrypt.hash("mypassword", saltRounds);
   ```

2. **Comparing a Password with a Hash**:
   ```javascript
   const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare("mypassword", hash);
   ```

### Conclusion

Bcrypt is a highly secure and widely used password hashing algorithm designed to make password storage more secure by adding unique salts and making it computationally expensive to hash passwords. This helps protect against many types of attacks like brute force and rainbow table attacks.

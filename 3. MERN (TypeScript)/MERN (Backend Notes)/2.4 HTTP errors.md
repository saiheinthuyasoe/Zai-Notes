# HTTP errors

**HTTP errors** are status codes returned by a web server to indicate the outcome of an HTTP request made by a client (such as a web browser). These codes help identify whether a request was successful, resulted in an error, or encountered some other condition. HTTP status codes are divided into several categories, with error codes typically falling into the 4xx and 5xx categories.

Certainly! HTTP status codes can be categorized into several classes based on their first digit, and codes in the **1xx**, **2xx**, and **3xx** ranges represent different outcomes from an HTTP request. Here's an overview of those categories:

### **1xx Informational Status Codes**
These codes indicate that the request has been received and understood, and that the client can continue with the request or ignore it if it has already completed.

| Status Code | Name                     | Description                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **100**     | Continue                 | The initial part of a request has been received and the client should continue with the request. |
| **101**     | Switching Protocols      | The server is switching protocols as requested by the client (e.g., upgrading to a different protocol). |
| **102**     | Processing               | The server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet (used in WebDAV). |

### **2xx Successful Status Codes**
These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

| Status Code | Name                     | Description                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **200**     | OK                       | The request has succeeded.                           |
| **201**     | Created                  | The request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created. |
| **202**     | Accepted                 | The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. |
| **203**     | Non-Authoritative Information | The server successfully processed the request, but is returning information that may be from another source. |
| **204**     | No Content               | The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. |
| **205**     | Reset Content            | The server successfully processed the request and is asking the client to reset the document view. |
| **206**     | Partial Content          | The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client. |
| **207**     | Multi-Status             | The message body that follows is an XML message and can contain multiple separate response codes (used in WebDAV). |
| **226**     | IM Used                  | The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance. |

### **3xx Redirection Status Codes**
These codes indicate that further action is needed to fulfill the request, usually involving redirection to another resource.

| Status Code | Name                     | Description                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **300**     | Multiple Choices         | The request has more than one possible response. The user or user agent can select one of them. |
| **301**     | Moved Permanently        | The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, and future requests should be directed to that URL. |
| **302**     | Found                    | The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL. (Commonly used for URL redirection.) |
| **303**     | See Other                | The response to the request can be found at another URI using a GET method. |
| **304**     | Not Modified             | The resource has not been modified since the last request, and the client can use the cached version. |
| **305**     | Use Proxy                | The requested resource must be accessed through the proxy given by the Location field. (Note: This code is not widely used due to security concerns.) |
| **306**     | Switch Proxy             | No longer used, but was previously used for a subsequent request to switch proxies. |
| **307**     | Temporary Redirect       | The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL, and the client should repeat the request at that URL using the same method. |
| **308**     | Permanent Redirect       | The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, similar to 301 but does not allow changing the HTTP method. |


Yes, the lists I provided cover the standard HTTP error status codes defined by the HTTP/1.1 specification and commonly used in web development. However, there can be additional error codes or variations depending on the server software or frameworks used. Hereâ€™s a recap, ensuring clarity and completeness:

### **4xx Client Error Codes**

These errors indicate that the client appears to have made an error in the request.

| **412**     | Precondition Failed         | The server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request. |
| **413**     | Payload Too Large           | The request entity is larger than the server is willing or able to process. |
| **414**     | URI Too Long                | The URI provided was too long for the server to process. |
| **415**     | Unsupported Media Type      | The server refuses to accept the request because the payload format is in an unsupported format. |
| **416**     | Range Not Satisfiable       | The client has asked for a portion of the file, but the server cannot supply that portion. |
| **417**     | Expectation Failed          | The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field. |
| **426**     | Upgrade Required            | The client should switch to a different protocol, such as TLS/1.0. |
| **428**     | Precondition Required       | The origin server requires the request to be conditional. |
| **429**     | Too Many Requests           | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. |
| **431**     | Request Header Fields Too Large | The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large. |
| **451**     | Unavailable For Legal Reasons | The user requests an illegal resource. |

### **5xx Server Error Codes**

These errors indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

| Status Code | Name                        | Description                                          |

| **501**     | Not Implemented             | The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. |
| **502**     | Bad Gateway                 | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server. |
| **503**     | Service Unavailable          | The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overload or maintenance. |
| **504**     | Gateway Timeout             | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server. |
| **505**     | HTTP Version Not Supported   | The server does not support the HTTP protocol version that was used in the request. |
| **511**     | Network Authentication Required | The client needs to authenticate to gain network access. |

# AWS Setup

Here’s a detailed guide to help you set up an AWS IAM user with programmatic access and the necessary permissions to interact with Amazon S3.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. **Login to AWS Console**

- Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
- Sign in with your AWS credentials.

#### 2. **Navigate to IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

- In the AWS Management Console, type "IAM" in the search bar and click on **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) from the search results.

#### 3. **Create a New User**

- On the left-hand menu, click on **Users**.
- Then, click on the **Add users** button.

#### 4. **Set Up the New User**

- **User name**: Enter a name for the user (e.g., `s3-user`).
- **Access type**: Select the checkbox for **Programmatic access**. This will allow the user to use the AWS CLI, SDKs, or other tools to interact with AWS programmatically.
- Click **Next: Permissions** to proceed.

#### 5. **Attach Permissions (Grant S3 Access)**

- On the **Set permissions** page, choose **Attach policies directly**.
- In the search bar, type **AmazonS3FullAccess** and select the policy that appears.
  - **AmazonS3FullAccess** provides the user full access to all S3 actions. If you want more restrictive access, you can choose a different policy or create a custom one.
- Click **Next: Tags** (optional).

#### 6. **(Optional) Add Tags**

- You can add key-value pairs (tags) to help identify or categorize this user (this is optional and can be skipped).
- After adding tags (if needed), click **Next: Review**.

#### 7. **Review and Create the User**

- Review all the settings you’ve selected (programmatic access, policy, etc.).
- Once everything looks good, click **Create user**.

#### 8. **Download the Credentials**

- After successfully creating the user, you will see a screen displaying the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.
  - **Important**: Download these credentials as a **CSV file** or copy them and store them in a safe place. You **won't** be able to view the secret access key again after this point.
- These credentials are required to interact with AWS programmatically (e.g., via the AWS SDK or CLI).

### What You Should Have Now:

- **Access Key ID**: This is the public identifier for the IAM user.
- **Secret Access Key**: This is the private key used to authenticate the programmatic requests made to AWS.

---

### Important: Security Best Practices

- **Keep the credentials secure**: Store them in a secure place like an environment file (`.env`).
- **Never hard-code** the Access Key ID or Secret Access Key into your source code, especially if your code is publicly accessible.

### Example Environment File (`.env`)

Once you have the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**, you can store them in an environment file to use in your code:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
AWS_REGION=your-preferred-region
```

Here's an example of what your `.env` file should look like with **actual values** for the AWS credentials and settings:

```plaintext
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYXXXXXXXX
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=my-example-bucket
```

### Explanation:

- **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: This is your unique access key ID (e.g., `AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`).
- **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: This is your secret access key (e.g., `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYXXXXXXXX`). Keep this secure and do not share it publicly.
- **AWS_REGION**: This is the AWS region where your S3 bucket is located (e.g., `us-east-1` for the N. Virginia region). You can find the region when creating your S3 bucket or in your AWS S3 dashboard.
- **AWS_BUCKET_NAME**: This is the name of your S3 bucket (e.g., `my-example-bucket`).

### Example Use Case:

If you have a bucket named **`my-image-storage`** in the **`us-west-2`** region, your `.env` file would look like this:

```plaintext
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=my-image-storage
```

This file will allow your application to authenticate with AWS and interact with your S3 bucket programmatically.

Make sure to keep this file **secret** and do not push it to version control (e.g., add `.env` to your `.gitignore`).

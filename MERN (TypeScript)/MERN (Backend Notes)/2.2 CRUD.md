# What is CRUD ?

**CRUD** stands for **Create, Read, Update, and Delete**, which are the four basic operations performed on databases or persistent storage systems. These operations are fundamental to managing data and are commonly used in the context of web applications and software development.

Here’s a breakdown of what each operation does:

1. **Create**: This operation is used to add new data to the database or storage. In SQL, this would be an `INSERT` statement, while in web development, it could be a form submission that creates a new user or product.

2. **Read**: This operation is used to retrieve or fetch data from the database. In SQL, this is typically done using a `SELECT` statement. It allows users or systems to view the data.

3. **Update**: This operation modifies existing data in the database. For example, in SQL, an `UPDATE` statement is used to change data in existing records.

4. **Delete**: This operation removes data from the database. In SQL, a `DELETE` statement is used to permanently remove records.

### Example in a web application:
Imagine a simple web app for managing products:
- **Create**: A form allows users to add a new product (e.g., "Add New Product").
- **Read**: Users can view a list of all products or a specific product's details (e.g., "View Product").
- **Update**: Users can edit a product's information, such as changing its price or description (e.g., "Edit Product").
- **Delete**: Users can remove a product from the system (e.g., "Delete Product").

These CRUD operations are commonly implemented using RESTful APIs, where different HTTP methods are used:
- `POST` → Create
- `GET` → Read
- `PUT`/`PATCH` → Update
- `DELETE` → Delete

CRUD is a foundation for most software systems that deal with data management.

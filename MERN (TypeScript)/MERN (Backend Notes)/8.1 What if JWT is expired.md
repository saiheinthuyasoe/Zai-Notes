# What if JWT is expired?

When a JSON Web Token (JWT) expires, the behavior of your application will depend on how you've implemented JWT handling in your authentication logic. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of what typically happens when a JWT expires:

### 1. **Client-Side Behavior**

- **Stale Token**: Once a JWT expires, the client should not include it in requests for protected resources. If the client does send an expired token, the server will reject the request.
  
- **Handling Expiration**: Applications usually implement logic to handle token expiration gracefully. For example:
  - **Token Refresh**: Many applications use a refresh token mechanism. When the access token (JWT) expires, the client can send the refresh token to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.
  - **Logout**: If no refresh token is provided, the user might be required to log in again.

### 2. **Server-Side Behavior**

- **Token Validation**: When the server receives a JWT, it checks the token's validity, including whether it has expired.
  
- **Response to Expired Tokens**: If the token is expired:
  - The server typically responds with a **401 Unauthorized** status code and a message indicating that the token is no longer valid or has expired. For example:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Token has expired"
    }
    ```

### 3. **Implementing Refresh Tokens**

To manage expired JWTs effectively, many applications implement a refresh token strategy:

- **What are Refresh Tokens?**
  - Refresh tokens are long-lived tokens that can be used to obtain new access tokens (JWTs) without requiring the user to log in again.

- **How it Works**:
  1. When the user logs in, the server issues both an access token (JWT) and a refresh token.
  2. The client uses the access token for authorized requests.
  3. When the access token expires, the client sends the refresh token to a designated endpoint (e.g., `/refresh-token`).
  4. The server validates the refresh token and issues a new access token if it is valid and not expired.
  5. The client can then use the new access token for further requests.

### 4. **Security Considerations**

- **Short-Lived Access Tokens**: Access tokens should have a short expiration time (e.g., 15 minutes) to limit exposure if the token is compromised.
  
- **Long-Lived Refresh Tokens**: Refresh tokens can be set to expire after a longer period (e.g., days or weeks), but they should also be handled securely:
  - They should be stored securely (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies) to prevent access by JavaScript.
  - Implement rotation for refresh tokens to minimize the risk of misuse.

- **Revocation Strategy**: Have a strategy for revoking refresh tokens if necessary, such as when a user logs out or if suspicious activity is detected.

### Summary

- When a JWT expires, it can no longer be used for authentication, and the server will reject requests that include it.
- Clients should implement mechanisms to handle expired tokens gracefully, such as using refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again.
- Properly managing token expiration and refresh strategies is crucial for maintaining secure and user-friendly authentication in applications.

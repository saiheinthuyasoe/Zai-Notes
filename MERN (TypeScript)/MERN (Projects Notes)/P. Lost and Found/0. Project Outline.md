     - LostItem (create, read, update, delete).
     - FoundItem (create, read, update, delete).
     - User (register, login, retrieve, and manage users).
7. **Middleware**
   - Create authentication middleware with `JWT` to secure routes and allow only authorized access.
8. **AWS S3 Service**

9. **Utility Functions**

   - Create a JWT token generator utility function for user authentication.

10. **Routes**

- Set up routes for `LostItem`, `FoundItem`, and `User` to map endpoints to their respective controllers.

11. **Main Application Setup**

- Initialize the Express app, connect to MongoDB, set up routes, and configure a base route for health checks.

12. **Running the Project**

- Run the application in development mode with nodemon and configure build/start scripts for production deployment.

13. **Testing with Postman**

- Open the Postman Application and test all the (CRUD) operation.

### Frontend Outline

#### **Step 1: Project Setup and Initialization**

1. **Create a Next.js project with TypeScript:**
   - Initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript enabled.
   - Set up your project structure with `/src` for organized file management.
2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Core dependencies: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
   - Optional: Axios for API requests, React Query or SWR for data fetching.

#### **Step 2: Tailwind CSS Configuration**

1. **Install Tailwind CSS** following Next.js instructions.
2. Configure `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
3. Add base styles to `globals.css` to enable Tailwind utility classes across the app.

#### **Step 3: Environment Variables**

1. Create a `.env.local` file for API base URLs, authentication secrets, and other environment-specific variables.
2. Set up variables for development and production.

#### **Step 4: Authentication and Authorization**

1. **User Context Setup:**
   - Implement a context provider for authentication to manage user sessions.
   - Store JWT tokens in a secure location (e.g., `localStorage` or `httpOnly` cookies) and manage logged-in user state.
2. **Login and Signup Pages:**
   - Design pages for user login and signup with Tailwind CSS.
   - Handle authentication by sending requests to the backend and storing tokens in state.

#### **Step 5: Create Core Components**

1. **Reusable Components:**
   - Create a `Button`, `Input`, and `Card` component to reuse throughout the app.
   - Add a `Loader` or `Spinner` component to show during data loading.
2. **Navigation Components:**
   - Implement a `Navbar` with links to core pages and conditionally render login/signup or logout options based on user state.
   - Add a `Footer` for consistent branding and links.

#### **Step 6: Page Components**

1. **Home Page:**

   - Display an overview of the app and a list of recently added lost and found items.
   - Add a search bar for users to filter items by name, location, or date.

2. **Lost Items Page:**

   - Display a list of all lost items with filters (e.g., by status, date lost).
   - Enable sorting and searching functionality for easy navigation.
   - Include a button to add a new lost item (if authenticated).

3. **Found Items Page:**

   - Similar to Lost Items, but display found items with relevant information.
   - Include a button to add a new found item (if authenticated).

4. **User Profile Page:**

   - Show user details and list of items the user has posted (both lost and found).
   - Allow users to edit their profile and manage their posted items.
   - Admins can view all users and manage user profiles.

5. **Item Detail Page (Lost and Found):**

   - Display full details for a selected item, including item name, description, location, date, and contact info.
   - If the user is the item owner, allow editing and deletion of the item.

6. **Contact Us Page:**
   - Provide contact details and a form for users to send feedback or ask for support.

#### **Step 7: Form Handling and Validation**

1. **Form Components for Lost/Found Item Creation:**
   - Implement forms for users to create or edit lost and found items.
   - Use validation with a library like Yup or built-in validation for fields like `name`, `description`, and `date`.
2. **User Profile Form:**
   - Include fields for updating user information, such as `username`, `email`, and `password`.

#### **Step 8: Data Fetching and State Management**

1. **API Client Setup:**
   - Create a service layer with Axios (or React Query) to handle API requests.
2. **Data Caching:**
   - Use React Query or SWR to cache fetched data and improve performance.
3. **Global State Management:**
   - Store user authentication and session data in context or state management.

#### **Step 9: AWS S3 Integration for Image Uploads**

1. **Upload Image Component:**
   - Create a component to handle image uploads to S3 (using the backend service).
   - Display preview thumbnails for uploaded images.
2. **Display Uploaded Images:**
   - Ensure images are fetched and displayed on item detail and list pages.

#### **Step 10: Responsive Design**

1. **Responsive Layouts:**
   - Use Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities to ensure mobile, tablet, and desktop compatibility.
2. **Test Responsiveness:**
   - Test layouts on different devices or using browser dev tools to ensure a seamless experience.

#### **Step 11: Error Handling and Notifications**

1. **Error Alerts and Success Messages:**
   - Display error messages for failed actions (e.g., login failure, invalid form).
2. **Toast Notifications:**
   - Use a library like `react-toastify` to show toast notifications for user actions (e.g., successful login, item added).

#### **Step 12: Deployment**

1. **Deploy with Vercel:**
   - Deploy your Next.js frontend on Vercel for a seamless hosting experience.
2. **Connect to Backend:**
   - Set environment variables for production to connect to your hosted backend.

#### **Step 13: Testing and Optimization**

1. **Test Functionality:**
   - Ensure all forms, CRUD actions, and image uploads work as expected.
2. **SEO and Performance Optimization:**
   - Configure SEO metadata on pages and optimize images.
3. **Accessibility Checks:**
   - Use accessibility tools to make sure the app is usable by all users.

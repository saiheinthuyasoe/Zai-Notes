**What does “Infrastructure as Software” mean?**
In traditional computing, infrastructure means the physical stuff like servers, storage devices, and networks that you need to run applications. You’d have to buy, set up, and maintain this hardware yourself.

In cloud computing, you don’t need to own or physically manage this hardware. Instead, you can control and manage your infrastructure using software. You can "create," "configure," or "remove" resources (like servers or storage) with just a few clicks or lines of code, as if they were part of a program.

**Example: Traditional vs. Cloud:**

1. **Traditional Way:**
   - If you wanted to host a website, you’d buy a server, install software on it, connect it to a network, and make sure it’s always running.
   - If you need more servers (for more traffic), you’d have to buy and set up new ones manually.

2. **Cloud Way (Infrastructure as Software):**
   - You log in to a cloud provider’s dashboard (like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
   - You “spin up” a virtual server with a few clicks, configure it to meet your needs, and start using it instantly.
   - If you need more servers, you can add them automatically with a script or a command. When you’re done, you can delete them just as easily.

**Simple Example:**
Imagine you run an online store that gets busy during holidays. 

- With traditional hardware, you’d need to buy and set up extra servers ahead of time to handle the traffic.
- With cloud, you can program your system to **automatically add more servers** (using software) during busy times and remove them when traffic slows. You only pay for what you use, and there’s no physical setup needed!

It’s like having a remote control for your infrastructure—you press buttons (or write code), and the resources appear or disappear as needed.

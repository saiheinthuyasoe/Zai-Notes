**What is Cloud Computing?**
Imagine you need a computer to do some work, like storing files, running apps, or hosting a website. Instead of buying and setting up your own computer or servers, you "rent" these resources over the internet from a cloud provider like AWS (Amazon Web Services). You only pay for what you use, like renting a car or paying for electricity.

**How Does It Work?**
The resources (like storage, computing power, or databases) are stored in big data centers that belong to the cloud provider. These are like giant warehouses full of powerful computers. You access these resources via the internet and use them as if they were on your own computer.

**Simple Example:**
Let’s say you want to start an online bakery. To do this, you need:

1. A website to showcase your cakes.
2. Storage for all the photos and data.
3. Computing power to handle orders and payments.

Instead of buying servers (which are expensive and need maintenance), you use a cloud provider like AWS:

- You use their **storage service** to save your photos.
- You use their **computing power** to run your website and process payments.
- You pay only for the storage and computing power you use, and you can increase or decrease your usage as your business grows.

This is like building with blocks—taking only what you need and paying only for what you use. It's easy, flexible, and cost-effective!

**Traditional Computing: Infrastructure as Hardware**

In the old way of doing things, if you needed to run a website or an app, you had to **buy and manage physical hardware** like servers and storage systems. This came with several challenges:

1. **Big upfront cost:** You had to buy expensive equipment (servers, storage, etc.) and set it up in a dedicated space, like a data center.
2. **Time-consuming setup:** It took weeks or months to order, install, and configure the hardware.
3. **Guesswork:** You had to predict how much power and storage you’d need in the future.
   - If you guessed **too high**, you’d waste money on hardware that just sits idle.
   - If you guessed **too low**, your system might crash when demand spikes, leaving you scrambling to buy more hardware.
4. **Ongoing costs:** You needed staff to maintain the hardware and keep it secure, which added to the expense.

**Example: Launching a Website**

Imagine you want to start a website for selling clothes:

1. **In the Traditional Way:**

   - You’d have to buy physical servers.
   - Rent or build space in a data center to keep them safe and cool.
   - Hire people to maintain the servers.
   - Spend weeks setting everything up before you could even launch your website.

   **If your website suddenly became popular,** you might run out of server capacity and need to buy more hardware—causing delays and extra costs. Or, if your website didn’t get as much traffic as expected, you’d be stuck with expensive hardware you don’t need.

**Why is this a Problem?**
It’s expensive, slow, and inefficient. If your needs change, you’re either overprepared (wasting money) or underprepared (losing opportunities).

Cloud computing fixes all of this! Instead of owning and managing physical hardware, you “rent” what you need from a cloud provider. It’s faster, cheaper, and scales up or down easily depending on your needs. **It’s like having a flexible, on-demand tool kit, rather than building everything from scratch.**

# What abilities are required of software engineers?

Software engineers create software to solve real-world problems. To do this, they need both **technical skills** and **soft skills**. Most software engineers start with a bachelorâ€™s degree in fields like computer science, information technology, or computer engineering.

### **Technical Skills**  
These are the hard skills software engineers need to do their job:  
- **Programming languages**: Like Java, Python, C, C++, or Visual Studio.  
- **Database architecture**: Designing and managing databases.  
- **Operating systems**: Understanding systems like Windows, macOS, or Linux.  
- **Agile and Scrum**: Methods for managing projects efficiently.  
- **Object-oriented programming**: A way of organizing code for better efficiency.  
- **Testing and debugging**: Finding and fixing errors in software.  
- **Cloud computing**: Working with cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.  
- **Version control**: Tools like Git to track and manage code changes.  

### **Soft Skills**  
These are personal skills that help software engineers work effectively:  
- **Problem-solving**: Finding solutions to challenges.  
- **Attention to detail**: Being careful and precise in their work.  
- **Continuous learning**: Keeping up with new technologies.  
- **Teamwork and communication**: Working well with others and explaining ideas clearly.  
- **Agile project management**: Managing tasks and deadlines in a fast-paced environment.  
- **Multitasking**: Handling multiple tasks at once.  

### **The Future of Software Engineering**  
The future looks bright for software engineers because technology is growing fast. Almost every industry, from healthcare to entertainment, needs software engineers. Jobs like software developers, testers, and quality assurance analysts are expected to grow by **22% by 2035**, which is much faster than most other jobs.  

In short, software engineering is a field with lots of opportunities, and it requires a mix of technical knowledge and personal skills to succeed.

### **What is IoC (Inversion of Control)?**

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle that reverses the traditional flow of control in a program. Instead of the program controlling how objects are created and interact, the control is handed over to a container or framework.

In simpler terms, **IoC means letting a framework manage the dependencies (objects) in your application**. You don’t manually create and manage objects; the framework does it for you.

### **What is DI (Dependency Injection)?**

Dependency Injection (DI) is a specific way to implement IoC. It means that **dependencies (objects or resources that a class needs to do its work) are provided to the class from outside, rather than the class creating them itself**.

DI is a technique used to supply the necessary dependencies to a class automatically, which makes the code cleaner, more testable, and loosely coupled.

### **IoC vs. DI**

- **IoC** is the broader concept where you delegate control to a framework.
- **DI** is one way to achieve IoC by injecting dependencies into a class.

### **How IoC and DI Work in Spring**

Spring is a framework that uses the IoC principle. Spring's **IoC container** is responsible for managing the lifecycle of objects and injecting dependencies into them.

#### Example:

1. **Without IoC and DI**:

   ```java
   public class UserService {
       private UserRepository userRepository;

       public UserService() {
           userRepository = new UserRepository(); // UserService creates the dependency
       }

       public void getUserDetails() {
           userRepository.findUser();
       }
   }
   ```

   Here, `UserService` is tightly coupled to `UserRepository` because it creates the object itself. This makes the code hard to test and maintain.

2. **With IoC and DI (Using Spring)**:

   ```java
   @Component
   public class UserService {
       private final UserRepository userRepository;

       // Dependency injected via constructor
       @Autowired
       public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
           this.userRepository = userRepository;
       }

       public void getUserDetails() {
           userRepository.findUser();
       }
   }

   @Component
   public class UserRepository {
       public void findUser() {
           System.out.println("Fetching user details...");
       }
   }

   @SpringBootApplication
   public class Application {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);

           UserService userService = context.getBean(UserService.class);
           userService.getUserDetails();
       }
   }
   ```

   - **What happens here?**
     - `UserService` and `UserRepository` are annotated with `@Component`, telling Spring to manage these classes.
     - The Spring IoC container automatically creates and injects a `UserRepository` instance into `UserService` via the constructor.
     - You don’t have to manually create objects, making the code loosely coupled and easier to test.

### **Types of DI in Spring**

1. **Constructor Injection** (shown above): Dependencies are passed through the constructor.
2. **Setter Injection**:

   ```java
   @Component
   public class UserService {
       private UserRepository userRepository;

       @Autowired
       public void setUserRepository(UserRepository userRepository) {
           this.userRepository = userRepository;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Field Injection** (not recommended as much for testing):
   ```java
   @Component
   public class UserService {
       @Autowired
       private UserRepository userRepository;
   }
   ```

### **Key Benefits of IoC and DI**

- **Loose Coupling**: Classes don’t need to know about the implementation details of their dependencies.
- **Improved Testability**: Dependencies can be mocked or swapped easily for testing.
- **Better Maintenance**: Changes in one class don’t ripple through others as dependencies are injected and managed externally.
- **Simplified Code**: Spring handles the object creation and wiring, reducing boilerplate code.

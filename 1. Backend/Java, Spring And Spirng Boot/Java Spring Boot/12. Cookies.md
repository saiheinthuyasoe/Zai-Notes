### **What Are Cookies? 🍪**

Cookies are small pieces of data stored in your web browser by websites. They help websites remember information about you, like your login status, preferences, or shopping cart items.

### **Example of How Cookies Work:**

#### **1️⃣ Without Cookies (Every Time Fresh Start)**

Imagine visiting an online store, adding items to your cart, and leaving the site. When you return, your cart is empty because the website didn't remember your selections.

#### **2️⃣ With Cookies (Remembering You)**

With cookies, the website saves your cart data, so when you return, your items are still there.

### **Simple Example in JavaScript:**

#### **Setting a Cookie:**

```js
document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT";
```

👉 This stores "John" as the username until December 31, 2025.

#### **Getting a Cookie:**

```js
console.log(document.cookie);
```

👉 This retrieves all stored cookies for the site.

#### **Deleting a Cookie:**

```js
document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC";
```

👉 This removes the cookie by setting an old expiration date.

# What is CORS?

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature in web browsers that controls how resources on a website can be requested from another domain. It prevents unauthorized websites from accessing your site's data.

### Example:

Imagine you have a website at **`https://mywebsite.com`**, and it wants to fetch data from **`https://api.example.com`**. By default, the browser blocks this request due to security reasons.

To allow this, the server (`api.example.com`) must enable CORS by adding headers like:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://mywebsite.com
```

If the server allows it, the browser permits the request. Otherwise, it gets blocked.

### Simple Use Case:

✅ **Allowed CORS (Works)**

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
  method: "GET",
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

❌ **Blocked CORS (Not Allowed)**
If `api.example.com` doesn’t allow `mywebsite.com`, the request is blocked, and you see an error in the console.

CORS is essential for security but can be configured to allow trusted domains to access resources. 🚀

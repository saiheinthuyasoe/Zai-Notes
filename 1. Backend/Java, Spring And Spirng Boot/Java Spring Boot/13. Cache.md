### **What is Cache? 🚀**

Cache is a temporary storage that helps websites and apps load faster by saving frequently used data. Instead of downloading the same files again, your browser or device can quickly retrieve them from the cache.

### **Example of How Cache Works:**

🛒 **Imagine an Online Store**  
1️⃣ **Without Cache**: Every time you visit, the website re-downloads images, styles, and scripts. This takes time.  
2️⃣ **With Cache**: The browser saves these files, so when you return, the page loads much faster.

### **Types of Cache:**

1️⃣ **Browser Cache** – Saves website files (CSS, images, JavaScript) on your device.  
2️⃣ **Server Cache** – Stores frequently requested data on the server to speed up responses.  
3️⃣ **CDN Cache** – Content Delivery Networks store copies of a website in different locations worldwide for faster access.

### **Example in JavaScript:**

#### **Storing Data in Cache (LocalStorage)**

```js
localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark"); // Saves theme preference
console.log(localStorage.getItem("theme")); // Retrieves stored value
```

#### **Clearing Cache (JavaScript)**

```js
localStorage.clear(); // Removes all stored data
```

#### **Clearing Cache (Browser)**

👉 Open DevTools (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`) → Clear Browsing Data → Select "Cached Images and Files."

### **Why Use Cache?**

✅ **Faster Loading** – Speeds up websites and apps.  
✅ **Reduces Data Usage** – No need to download the same files repeatedly.  
✅ **Improves Performance** – Less load on servers.

⛔ **Downside?** Sometimes, old cached data can cause problems (e.g., showing outdated content). Clearing cache fixes this! 🚀

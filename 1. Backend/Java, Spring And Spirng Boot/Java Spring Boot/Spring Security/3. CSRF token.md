**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** is a type of security attack that tricks a user into performing actions on a website without their consent. The attacker exploits the user's authenticated session to perform malicious activities, like changing account details, transferring money, or making purchases.

### **How CSRF Works (Simple Explanation)**

1. A user logs into a trusted website (e.g., a bank) and remains authenticated (session is active).
2. The attacker sends the user a link, email, or embeds a malicious script on a third-party website.
3. When the user unknowingly clicks the link or loads the malicious page, the browser sends a request to the trusted website using the user’s existing session credentials (cookies).
4. Since the website thinks the request is coming from the authenticated user, it executes the malicious action.

### **Real-Life Example**

#### Scenario:

1. **You’re logged into a bank website.**
   - Your browser stores your session cookie for the bank.
2. **An attacker sends you a phishing email:**
   - The email contains a hidden request to transfer money.
   - Example of a hidden request:
     ```html
     <img
       src="https://www.yourbank.com/transfer?amount=1000&toAccount=attacker123"
       style="display:none;"
     />
     ```
3. **You unknowingly open the email or visit a malicious website.**
   - Your browser executes the request to the bank because your session is still active.
4. **Result:**
   - The bank processes the request as if you initiated it, transferring money to the attacker.

### **Why CSRF Happens**

1. **Browser Behavior**:

   - Browsers automatically include cookies (for authenticated sessions) with every request to a website.

2. **Lack of Verification**:
   - The server doesn’t confirm whether the request was intentionally made by the user.

### **How to Prevent CSRF**

1. **CSRF Tokens**:

   - The server generates a unique token for each user session and embeds it in forms or requests.
   - Example: A form includes a hidden input field:
     ```html
     <form action="/transfer" method="POST">
       <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="uniqueToken123" />
       <input type="number" name="amount" />
       <input type="text" name="toAccount" />
       <button type="submit">Transfer</button>
     </form>
     ```
   - The server checks the token before processing the request.

2. **SameSite Cookies**:

   - Restrict cookies to be sent only on requests originating from the same domain.
   - Example: Set the `SameSite` attribute for cookies:
     ```plaintext
     Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=abc123; SameSite=Strict
     ```

3. **User Authentication with CAPTCHA**:

   - Add CAPTCHA to critical actions to ensure the request is intentionally made by a user.

4. **Use HTTP Referer Header**:
   - Check the origin of the request to verify it matches your domain.

### **CSRF vs XSS (Difference)**

- **CSRF**:

  - Exploits a user's authenticated session to make unintended requests.
  - Requires the victim to have an active session.

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**:
  - Injects malicious scripts into a web page to steal data or perform actions.
  - Targets users directly, not the server.

### **Summary**

CSRF is like someone forging your signature to perform actions on your behalf. By using CSRF tokens, setting cookie policies, and verifying requests, websites can protect users from such attacks.

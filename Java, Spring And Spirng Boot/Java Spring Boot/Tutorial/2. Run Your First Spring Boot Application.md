### **Step 2: Run Your First Spring Boot Application**

1. **Locate the Main Class**:

   - Open the file with the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, usually named something like `Application.java`.
   - This file serves as the entry point for your application.

2. **Run the Application**:

   - Right-click the file and choose **Run** (in IntelliJ) or run the following command in the terminal from the project root directory:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

3. **Verify**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
   - By default, youâ€™ll see a "Whitelabel Error Page," which means the server is running but no endpoint is configured.

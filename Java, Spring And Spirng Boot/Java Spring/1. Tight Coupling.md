# Type Coupling?

Tight coupling in Java Spring Boot (or any software development context) refers to a scenario where classes and their dependencies are closely connected, meaning that one class is heavily dependent on another. This dependency can make your code difficult to maintain, test, and extend because any change in one class can have a significant impact on the dependent classes.

### Example of Tight Coupling
Imagine you have two classes, `Car` and `Engine`, and the `Car` class directly instantiates the `Engine` class like this:

```java
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine(); // Tight coupling
    }

    public void start() {
        engine.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, `Car` is tightly coupled with `Engine` because it directly creates an instance of `Engine`. If you wanted to switch to a different type of engine (e.g., `ElectricEngine`), you would need to modify the `Car` class, breaking the open/closed principle (OCP) of SOLID design principles.

### Why Tight Coupling is Problematic
1. **Difficult to Maintain**: Changes in one class require changes in all dependent classes.
2. **Hard to Extend**: Introducing new functionality might require significant code modifications.
3. **Difficult to Test**: Unit testing becomes more complicated because you cannot easily replace dependencies with mocks or stubs.
4. **Less Flexibility**: Tight coupling makes the system less flexible, as swapping dependencies is hard.

### How to Reduce Tight Coupling in Spring Boot
Spring Boot (and the broader Spring Framework) provides mechanisms like dependency injection (DI) to address tight coupling:

1. **Constructor Injection**:
   ```java
   public class Car {
       private final Engine engine;

       @Autowired
       public Car(Engine engine) { // Engine is injected here
           this.engine = engine;
       }

       public void start() {
           engine.start();
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Field Injection**:
   ```java
   public class Car {
       @Autowired
       private Engine engine; // Engine is injected here

       public void start() {
           engine.start();
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Setter Injection**:
   ```java
   public class Car {
       private Engine engine;

       @Autowired
       public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
           this.engine = engine;
       }

       public void start() {
           engine.start();
       }
   }
   ```

By using dependency injection, Spring Boot creates and injects the `Engine` dependency into the `Car` class, allowing you to swap out different implementations (e.g., `ElectricEngine`) without modifying the `Car` class, thereby promoting loose coupling.

### Benefits of Using Dependency Injection in Spring Boot
1. **Easier Testing**: You can inject mock objects for testing purposes.
2. **Greater Flexibility**: You can easily switch between different implementations of a dependency.
3. **Better Maintainability**: Changes in one component are less likely to impact other components.
4. **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: Spring handles the creation and management of dependencies, simplifying your codebase.

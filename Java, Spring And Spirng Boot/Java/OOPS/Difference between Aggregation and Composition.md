**Aggregation** and **Composition** are both types of associations in object-oriented programming, specifically for describing relationships between classes. They both represent "has-a" relationships, but they differ in terms of the **strength** of the relationship and the **lifetime dependency** between the objects.

### 1. **Aggregation**

- **Definition**: Aggregation is a **weaker** form of association where one class contains a reference to another class, but the **contained object can exist independently** of the container.
- **Relationship**: This is often called a **"has-a"** relationship. For example, a `Library` has a `Book`, but a `Book` can exist outside of the `Library`.
- **Lifetime**: The lifetime of the contained object is independent of the container. If the container object is destroyed, the contained object can still exist.

#### Example:

Imagine a `Library` and `Book` classes. A `Library` can have multiple `Books`, but a `Book` can also exist without being in a `Library`.

```java
class Book {
    String title;

    public Book(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }
}

class Library {
    List<Book> books; // Aggregation

    public Library(List<Book> books) {
        this.books = books;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Library` contains `Book` objects, but the `Book` objects aren’t dependent on the `Library` for their existence. They can exist independently, even if the `Library` is deleted.

### 2. **Composition**

- **Definition**: Composition is a **stronger** form of association where the container object **owns** the contained objects, and they cannot exist independently.
- **Relationship**: This is a **"part-of"** relationship. For example, an `Engine` is a part of a `Car`, and it doesn't make sense for the `Engine` to exist without the `Car` it belongs to.
- **Lifetime**: The lifetime of the contained object is tied to the container. If the container is destroyed, so are the contained objects.

#### Example:

Consider `Car` and `Engine` classes. An `Engine` is part of a `Car` and has no meaning or purpose without the `Car`.

```java
class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine; // Composition

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine(); // Creating an Engine that is part of the Car
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Engine` instance is created within the `Car` and is tied to it. When the `Car` is destroyed, the `Engine` is also destroyed, as it’s part of the `Car`.

### Summary of Differences

| Feature                      | Aggregation                                              | Composition                                               |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strength of Relationship** | Weaker (container can have reference)                    | Stronger (container owns parts)                           |
| **Lifetime Dependency**      | Independent (contained object can outlive the container) | Dependent (contained object cannot outlive the container) |
| **Example Relationship**     | `Library` and `Book`                                     | `Car` and `Engine`                                        |

Understanding these relationships helps in designing classes with the appropriate structure and dependency between objects.
